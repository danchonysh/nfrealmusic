	<p>All I ever wanted was somebody to hear me<br>
And all I ever wanted was somebody to feel me<br>
And everybody wanna tell me that I'm out of my head<br>
When I'm on the mic that's fine but that don't scare me<br>
It's been a long time but I'm back now<br>
Rap pow welcome to the rap house<br>
Rap pow will live till I pass out blackout blackout<br>
Everybody keep on wondering if I still rap now<br>
Are you serious, anybody out there hearing this?<br>
Yo I came in the game as a lyricist<br>
And I'ma leave like that, period<br>
You sniff lines, I write lines, you've now entered in my mind<br>
And you better get ready cause you might find<br>
I'm from a different place and my kind<br>
It's a little bit different than yours is<br>
Quit snoring hip hop isn't dead<br>
It's just been in mourning from the moment I quit recording<br>
Quick, record this<br>
Listen I'm warming up and you're misinformed if<br>
You think that I'm slipping up, this ain't sick enough, then I'll skip the chorus<br>
I've been here ain't nobody heard of me?<br>
Yeah I'ma turn this beat to a murder scene<br>
I don't live for the world<br>
I live for the King, I live for the King, focus<br>
Wrote this with emotion<br>
It's hard to get a break when the door's ain't open<br>
It's hard to get a shot when the gun ain't loaded<br>
And it's hard to make a living when nobody wanna notice. Hold it<br>
What am I insane maybe, plain crazy<br>
You put me in a room with a mic you will not restrain me<br>
You do what you wanted but you can't contain me<br>
Lazy is not a character trait of mine, don't wait in line<br>
This is the current condition of my state of mind<br>
Don't tell me that this isn't real<br>
Don't tell me this ain't how I feel<br>
This is all I have all I have<br>
All I ever wanted was somebody to get this<br>
All I ever wanted was somebody to play this<br>
Take my song, put it on their playlist and get goosebumps every time they play it, rate us<br>
If that's my calling or not Father, maybe I should just not bother<br>
Go back to that nine to five but I am not a quitter so quit that<br>
I never been a killer but I guarantee I kill tracks<br>
Put them in a coffin, lost in, rip that<br>
Trying to make an impact in rap, is that insane?<br>
Well, I guess so<br>
Rap though, better give me that pencil<br>
And you ain't ever gonna make it, it's all mental<br>
I am in a place where I can't let go ah!<br>
I still work a job and do this<br>
And y'all know what's stupid?<br>
I thought all you had to do was get a record deal and yo things start moving<br>
But that's not the case because most of the times the artists you hear<br>
You keep on thinking that artist is new but that artist has probably been at it for years<br>
Yeah, in the back of my mind thinking<br>
Am I wasting my time dreaming<br>
And I ain't got no money in my wallet but<br>
I guarantee there ain't no way that I am gonna leave this<br>
I need this I swear to y'all I need this<br>
And this hip-hop's in my veins if you cut me I'ma bleed it<br>
And yo. What you think I write write raps for no reason, no<br>
Take my pain and I put em in a song ever since them pills they took my mom<br>
I've been a different person, don't try to predict my verses<br>
What you're hearing now is me whether I'm in front or behind that curtain<br>
I stand behind these words I'm a Christian but I'm not perfect<br>
Don't tell me to calm down I'm calm now, listen I'm just working<br>
Yeah it might take a minute to get it but once you get it everything will be crystal clear<br>
I don't think they see my vision here I don't think they see my vision here!<br>
Don't tell me that this isn't real<br>
Don't tell me this ain't how I feel<br>
This is all I have. All I have<br>
Don't tell me that this isn't real<br>
Don't tell me this ain't how I feel<br>
This is all I have. All I have<br>
Don't tell me that this isn't real<br>
Don't tell me this ain't how I feel<br>
This is all I have. All I have<br>
All I have<br>
Don't tell me that this isn't real (this isn't real, this isn't real)<br>
This is all that I have, this is all that I have<br></p></li>
	
	

	
	

	<li>	<span  class="text1">Wake Up</span>
	
	<p>You spend your life in a dream that you can't escape<br>
'Cause you live your life in a coma, you're never awake<br>
If you'd open your eyes then maybe you'd see what's at stake<br>
You're sleeping, you're sleeping<br>
You make a lot of money and you live in a mansion<br>
And pretty much got everything that you could ever imagine<br>
But you feel like even though you got everything in the world<br>
You got nothing, so what you do then is you start going backwards<br>
You runnin' in a direction<br>
And you lookin' for something that isn't real<br>
And all you know is that you just gotta have it<br>
What you're doin' is sleepin'<br>
And thinking that you're awake and you're not<br>
And the problem is that you don't know what you're after<br>
So you put everything that you have into what you do<br>
Hoping that one day maybe you don't have to feel like you're empty<br>
But as you get older a lot of weight on your shoulders is getting heavy<br>
Then you look back and you start to regret things<br>
You only get one life<br>
And every time you lookin' at yours<br>
You feel like everything you have is a waste!<br>
And the problem and the reason you could never fill a hole in your life<br>
Is because you were never awake<br>
You spend your life in a dream that you can't escape<br>
'Cause you live your life in a coma, you're never awake<br>
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up<br>
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up<br>
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up<br>
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up<br>
You wake up in the morning<br>
But you feel like you never got up and go to work<br>
And you feelin' like you ain't got a purpose<br>
And you tryna get motivated but everything you do turns into a mess<br>
Like you ain't nothing but worthless<br>
And, yo, you look around<br>
A lot of these other people you lookin' at<br>
To you, you describe as perfect<br>
So you point a finger at God and tell him to do his job<br>
And fix ya' life up cause nothin' is workin'<br>
And you will try to hide and make it seem like it's nothin'<br>
But really you feel like everything is crashin' around you<br>
And you develop a problem in trustin' in other people<br>
Which later became an issue that will mentally pound you<br>
You only get one life<br>
But every time you lookin' at yours you feel like all you ever see are mistakes<br>
And the problem and the reason you could never move forward in life<br>
Is because you were never awake<br>
Wake up<br>
You spend your life in a dream that you can't escape<br>
'Cause you live your life in a coma, you're never awake<br>
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up<br>
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up<br>
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up<br>
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up<br>
You spend your life in a dream that you can't escape<br>
'Cause you live your life in a coma, you're never awake<br>
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up<br></p></li>
	
	
	<li>	<span  class="text1">Hands Up</span>
	
<p>A few words to define my music?<br>
I'd say it's pretty laid-back<br>


Let me see those hands up<br>
Let me see those hands up<br>
Let me see those hands up<br>
Let me see those hands up, hands up
<br>

Yo! Yeah, I'm like Ali when I write hooks (yeah), get it? Right hooks<br>
These songs are like the chapters of my life and this is my book<br>
Yo, you seein' me on these stages, go into a song, I'm turnin' these pages<br>
Turn the pages, welcome to chapter one of my life: "crazy"<br>
Yeah, let's call it that if ya'll don't mind, I got a dope mind with these Pope lines<br>
I don't smoke, I'm in a cold climate, so ya'll better hold on<br>
They tellin' me that I'm loco, um, tell me something I don't know<br>
Ain't that a clear picture, no photo, yeah, clear pictures, no photo<br>
And yo this ain't about the photos or the fame life (nah)<br>
I kill my flesh and live for God all in the same life<br>
So call me what you wanna, but I'ma do what I gotta, yup<br>
And anybody got a problem, shh (NF real music)
<br>

Let me see those hands up<br>
Let me see those hands up<br>
Let me see those hands up<br>
Let me see those hands up, hands up<br>


And yo, I started from the bottom, no Drake though, yeah I came in the game like, "hello"<br>
I came in the game like, "let's go"<br>
Oh, this beat might break your neck bones<br>
But that's okay, okay<br>
You ain't heard of me, then you so late<br>
So just take a seat of that cold plate<br>
And just let-let-let-let me explain<br>
Yo, "NF" be the logo<br>
"Capitol" be the label<br>
If I see beats on my table<br>
I swear, I'ma eat the whole plateful<br>
And that's my life<br>
I write what I mean so I might<br>
Go a little bit cray when I find mics<br>
I ain't doing it so I am in the limelight, 'cause that limelight, it ain't nothin'<br>
Am I in this for the money? Hey quit crackin' jokes<br>
'Cause we all know this industry is known for cuttin' throats<br>
And if this was all for money, I'd have quit years ago<br>
But it's not, so turn me up until my ears explode, let's go<br>


Let me see those hands up<br>
Let me see those hands up<br>
Let me see those hands up<br>
Let me see those hands up, hands up<br>


Let me see those hands up<br>
Let me see those hands up<br>
Let me see those hands up<br>
Hands up<br>
Oh let me see those hands up<br>
(Where you at? Where you at?)<br>
Let me see those hands up<br>
(Where you at? Where you at?)<br>
Let me see those hands up<br>
(Where you at? Where you at?)<br>
Let me see those hands up<br>
(Where you at? Where you at?)<br>
Hands up<br>
(W- w- w- w- where you at?)<br>


Let me see those hands up<br>
Let me see those hands up<br>
Let me see those hands up<br>
Let me see those hands up, hands up<br>
Let me see those hands up<br>
Let me see those hands up<br>
Let me see those hands up<br>
Let me see those hands up, hands up<br></p></li>

   

	<li>	<span  class="text1">Only One</span>
	
	<p>You put your hand into mine, and baby we flew<br>
And whenever you're not around I don't know what to do<br>
And I'd rather die than go on living without you<br>
You're the one for me<br>
You're the one for me<br>


You're the only one, only one<br>
Nothing's gonna hold us up<br>
I got you and after all that we've been through<br>
We've been through some things<br>
But it's okay, okay<br>
There's no way I'm leaving<br>
Baby believe it<br>


I put my hand into yours, and baby I knew<br>
That you would be there no matter what we go through<br>
You're not alone. I'll always be there for you<br>
Cause you're the one for me<br>
You're the one for me<br>

There's no way I'm leaving<br>
Baby believe it<br>



Girl, I don't want to sound like I'm on repeat<br>
I know that it sounds like it might seem weak<br>
Been through too much, I know it ain't easy<br>
To look at my face, it's difficult when you see this<br>
Hey we been falling apart and we've been trying to fix this<br>
I'm hoping and wishing that things will be different<br>
I don't want to lose you, I know that I miss this<br>
Cause you're the only one on my mind I listen to<br>


Trying to be the man that you need, I need time<br>
And I know that it seems I don't try<br>
But I promise I won't lie, Won't lie<br>
Every time I look in your eyes, Your eyes<br>
Girl, I get this feeling that I never had<br>
And I just want you to understand<br>


You're the only one, only one<br>
That is gonna hold us up<br>
I got you and after all that we've been through<br>
We've been through some things<br>
But it's okay, okay<br>
There's no way I'm leaving<br>
Baby believe it<br>

	<li>	<span  class="text1">Thing Called Love</span>
	
	<p>This thing called love<br>
Can be so cold<br>
It can be miserable<br>
Or it can be beautiful<br>
This thing called love<br>
Can be so cold<br>
Sometimes it's amazing<br>
Sometimes it's crazy<br>
This thing called love<br>
Check, check, eh<br>
Listen, Your love is like a drug that<br>
Everybody uses<br>
You wanna know the outcome<br>
Depends on how you use it<br>
Love could be your best friend<br>
Love can be your enemy<br>
Love can be the thing you wish you had<br>
But you don't ever see<br>
Love can be the reason why<br>
You're afraid to have it<br>
Some say it like it means something<br>
Others use it like a habit<br>
And some would say it's tragic<br>
Some say it's beautiful<br>
Some say it's black and it's dark<br>
Like a funeral<br>
Some would die for it<br>
Some don't think it's even real<br>
Some say they understand<br>
But don't know how it feels<br>
Some say that it's alive<br>
Some say that it can kill<br>
But most of us that's depending on it<br>
Know that sometimes it will<br>
I ain't gonna sugarcoat it<br>
Yea, sometimes it might surround you<br>
One minute it's saving you<br>
Next it's trying to drown you<br>
Some people want to show it<br>
But were never taught how to<br>
And some of us is searching for it<br>
Feeling like it never found you<br>
This thing called love<br>
Can be so cold<br>
It can be miserable<br>
Or it can be beautiful<br>
This thing called love<br>
Can be so cold<br>
Sometimes it's amazing<br>
Sometimes it's crazy<br>
This thing called love<br>
Your love is like a privilege<br>
A lot of us abuse it<br>
Do with it what we want<br>
And start crying when we lose it<br>
Pretend that it ain't nothing to us<br>
Pretend like it's useless<br>
We don't know why we do this<br>
But yet, we still pursue it<br>
Love, it can consume you<br>
Turn you into something else<br>
Bury the real you so deep<br>
That you can't even find yourself<br>
Love, it can change you<br>
Love, it can (?)<br>
Be the best thing you ever had<br>
And kick you on the ground<br>
Yo, you get on that high level<br>
Yea, you scared to fall<br>
Cause you know if that person hurt you<br>
You gonna lose it all<br>
They told you they would be there for you<br>
They don't even call<br>
So that openness you used to have<br>
Has become a wall<br>
Some say that it's patient<br>
Some say that it's kind<br>
I don't think it's invisible<br>
But I know that it's blind<br>
To some it's only physical<br>
Alive in they mind<br>
It probably isn't there<br>
If you're struggling to find it<br>
This thing called love<br>
Can be so cold<br>
It can be miserable<br>
Or it can be beautiful<br>
This thing called love<br>
Can be so cold<br>
Sometimes it's amazing<br>
Sometimes it's crazy<br>
This thing called love<br>
This love got me on the down low<br>
Now I'm on the up high<br>
One minute I'm on the ground<br>
The next minute I'm in the sky<br>
I feel so invincible<br>
Sometimes dejected<br>
Forget it, I'm invisible<br>
I feel unprotected<br>
But I don't need nobody else<br>
Trust me, I'm fine<br>
I can't do this by myself<br>
I'm losing my mind<br>
I can see clearly<br>
Forget it<br>
I'm blind<br>
My heart says "DANGER"<br>
Can't you read the signs<br>
You been there through all the pain<br>
I swear I love it<br>
No matter what you do<br>
It don't disappear<br>
Does it<br>
I'd rather<br>
Spend a minute with love in my life<br>
Then go a million years without knowing<br>
What it is<br>
You better grab it<br>
You don't want to lose it<br>
It brings pain<br>
It's insane<br>
But the bruises<br>
My God can take that all away<br>
You (?) the right person<br>
And everything that you thought<br>
That wasn't worth it<br>
This thing called love<br>
Can be so cold<br>
It can be miserable<br>
Or it can be beautiful<br>
This thing called love<br>
Can be so cold<br>
Sometimes it's amazing<br>
Sometimes it's crazy<br>
This thing called love<br></p></li>
	
	
	<li>	<span  class="text1">Just Being Me</span>
	
	
<p>Feels like I'm in the sky<br>
Flying over clouds or somethin'<br>
I don't smoke weed, but you could say I'm high on somethin'<br>
It's like this music is my addiction, I call it my nicotine<br>
What you're witnessing is an addicted fiend and it sickens me (AH)<br>
Just a lame as how you picture me<br>
Give me that microphone and I'm gonna rip it so viciously<br>
Ain't you hearing the chemistry?<br>
Ain't it ironic I brought up chemistry?<br>
Cuz I was never good at math but I'm ill with the melody<br>
Since I was a kid, I had a dream that I would make it<br>
I spent thousands of hours writing music in that basement<br>
Even though I'm broke, you know why I still chase it?<br>
Cuz once you get a taste of it there is no replacement<br>
Yo, I don't rap, so millions of people will like me<br>
I rap, cuz there's millions of people just like me<br>
If you think I'm out of my mind, I ain't gonna argue, I might be<br>
But I'm not on the stage just for people to sightsee<br>
I'd rather die than let this dream go to waste<br>
You can tell that I ain't playin' by the look up on my face<br>
The world wants to tell us who we are and who we ain't<br>
But the person that I am is somethin' you can never change<br>
Yea I'm just being me, yea<br>
I'm just being me, yea<br>
I'm just being me, yea<br>
And this defines me<br>
Look into my music and you'll find me<br>
When I step into that studio, feels like I'm in my house<br>
If you listen to my music than you know what I'm about<br>
No I ain't never been the type to just sit around on the couch<br>
I get lost in these beats till my body passes out<br>
Let's rewind<br>
What ever happened to music that meant something<br>
Cuz nowadays I look around and music don't mean nothin'<br>
And to be honest what's really making me sick to my stomach<br>
Is everybody's runnin' around screaming they love it<br>
A lotta people think they understand the music biz<br>
I am not a genius but at least I know what music is<br>
Put a CD on the shelf, and you thinkin' you'll be filthy rich<br>
But you just become the definition of what filthy is<br>
The music, me and her, we've been through a lot together<br>
And I can tell somethin' ain't right if we are not together<br>
And yo God gave me the story so we plot together<br>
I get shot, whatever, this is who I am remember?<br>
I'd rather die than let this dream go to waste<br>
You can tell that I ain't playin' by the look up on my face<br>
The world wants to tell us who we are and who we ain't<br>
But the person that I am is somethin' you can never change<br>
Yea I'm just being me (yea)<br>
I'm just being me (yea)<br>
I'm just being me (yea)<br>
And this defines me<br>
Look into my music and you'll find me<br>
I'd rather die than let this dream go to waste<br>
You can tell that I ain't playin' by the look up on my face<br>
The world wants to tell us who we are and who we ain't<br>
But the person that I am is somethin' you can never change<br>
Yea I'm just being me (yea)<br>
I'm just being me (yea)<br>
I said that I'm just being me (yea)<br>
I'm being me, I'm just being me<br>
I'd rather die than let this dream go to waste<br>
You can tell that I ain't playin' by the look up on my face<br>
The world wants to tell us who we are and who we ain't<br>
But the person that I am is somethin' you can never change<br>
Yea I'm just being me (yea)<br>
I'm just being me (yea)<br>
I'm just being me (yea)<br>
And this defines me<br>
Look into my music and you'll find me<br>
