	<p>What, are you scared of me? It's embarassin'<br>
If it wasn't for me, you would've never wrote Therapy<br>
I've been here for you, but how come you're never there for me?<br>
It's a little bit twisted, but I miss when you and I had scary dreams<br>
I don't really wanna talk about it<br>
Well, that's too bad now, Nate, shut up!<br>
Now where were we?<br>
Now where were we?<br>
Way back in the day when<br>
You and I had it all mapped out in the basement<br>
Cryin' in your room like a baby<br>
"I wish mom was here"<br>
We all do so we wouldn't have to hear about it<br>
Every single record you don't really wanna change me<br>
Yeah, I'm the on that made this happen<br>
Do you really wanna get rid of your main attraction?<br>
Let's pack our bags and go back to Gladwin now<br>
Yeah, it's time for the third record<br>
And you know I got the content<br>
I don't wanna make you nervous<br>
But it ain't like it used to be<br>
We got a lotta people watchin'<br>
You told me that you don't want me in your life<br>
That's pretty hard to digest<br>
And I told you I'd leave when we die, and we ain't died yet<br>
Therapy Session was beautiful, Nate, but I'm wonderin' what's comin' next<br>
Yeah, get that stupid hat off of your head when I'm talkin' to you, you hear what I said?<br>
You don't like the prison I built you?<br>
Yeah, you wanna know what the funny thing is?<br>
You keep on talkin' to me like a stranger, but we've been together since you were a kid<br>
Took us from a no-name<br>
Told you everything was okay<br>
Now you tryna cut me out of it like I ain't never been a part of it<br>
I am the heart of it, I made this whole thing<br>
Yeah, I put us on the dope stage<br>
You must have no brain<br>
What's the point of having guns if you can't aim?<br>
What's the point of having blood with no vein?<br>
What's the point of having love with no pain?<br>
What I'm sayin' is me without you doesn't make any sense<br>
I know I'm intense in controlling, but you need to learn how to cope with it<br>
That's just the way that it is<br>
If you didn't want me to live in your house, you shouldn't have let me move in<br>
It's comfortable here and I like it, I got my own room and everything<br>
It don't get better than this!<br>
You say you wanna own your life, then wake up and take your own advice<br>
You just mad 'cause you know I'm right<br>
Yeah, I'm flattered you put me in Mansion, but you should've told 'em right<br>
'Bout your hands on the coldest nights<br>
You didn't tell 'em 'bout the times you and I used to hold he mic<br>
I mean, what are you, outta your mind?<br>
'Cause both of us will be<br>
Come on, let's go outside!<br>
Is this what you wanted?<br>
Both of us out in the open? Let's do it then<br>
I mean, why are you doin' this?<br>
I know that you're mad, but I'm not in the mood for this<br>
We got a record to drop<br>
So why you actin' like I'm not a part of it?<br>
And where is my shovel at?<br>
Prolly all back where it always is, you can't get rid of all of me<br>
I'm the reason why<br>
Nah, shut up, I don't wanna hear another sentence<br>
Hey, I'm NF, is it me or the fear talkin'? What a dumb question<br>
Yeah, it's real music 'til the day we die, right? Yeah, ain't that the slogan, Nathan?<br>
Thought I told you to keep your mouth shut<br>
I mean, so what? You know I never listen<br>
Let me guess<br>
We gon' dig a hole, kill the track, and prolly put a beat in it<br>
Rap about it for like three minutes<br>
Aye, that's pretty deep, isn't it?<br>
Wait a minute, you don't really think for a second that you're puttin' me in this?<br>
No, of course not, just a lil' deeper then we'll go inside and we can stop diggin'<br>
Woo!<br>
You had me scared for a second, I though we were diggin' my grave<br>
We did, what, you don't bein' afraid?<br>
It's a dose of your own medicine<br>
What, you don't like how it tastes?<br>
My therapist told me don't bury my issues, but I'ma be honest, man I'm feelin' great!<br>
I think it's only right we go back to where you were created<br>
I wrote a song for Jonny without you, but he ain't gon' like it, let's see how he takes it<br>
He prolly don't even remember us, does he?<br>
I wish I was buryin' anger, but both of us know I'ma need him for that song<br>
He still lives in the basement<br>
Almost done, shoulda done this a year ago<br>
I don't know why I waited<br>
You know how I get it, I put everything off of my personal life, you hear what I'm sayin'?<br>
That was a joke<br>
Yeah, it's hilarious, ain't it?<br>
You'll spend the rest of your life in my backyard or back of my mind, depends how you see it<br>
Put the shovel away, time to go back in the house now, you'll be out in a week<br>
Tellin' me you want your room back, that's funny, what, you ain't got nowhere to sleep?<br>
I'ma just look out the window and laugh at you, this is crazy to me<br>
'Cause I thought you had me in prison this whole time, but I'm the one holdin' the keys</p></li>
	
	
	<li><span class="text1p">Outcast</span>
	
	<p>Woke up in the cell, where am I at?<br>
Yeah, it's cold, but I like that<br>
What, am I trapped?<br>
Heart's beating out of my chest<br>
Door's locked, but the keys are in my hands<br>
Hm, yeah, that's weird, it doesn't make sense, does it?<br>
I make songs, I don't make friends, judge me<br>
Might smile, but it ain't that funny<br>
Sing along to the pain, they love it<br>
Life's like a merry-go-round<br>
And I'm still tryna figure it out<br>
I like space I don't fit in the crowds<br>
My whole life I've been airin' it out<br>
Oh, I'm gettin' into character now<br>
Feels wrong, but it feels right<br>
My feelings seal tight real nice<br>
But I will fight anything to win<br>
But I'm not Mike Tyson, I won't bite ya'<br>
But I will tell you if I don't like you<br>
I am not the norm<br>
I got my own shoes, I ain't tryna fit in yours<br>
I ain't never been married, but I've felt divorced<br>
Hi, I'm Nate, have we met before<br>
Somebody told you I was wack? Check the source<br>
Somebody told you I was back? Yes, of course<br>
You got a problem with the fans? There's the door<br>
You lookin' for the old me? Check the morgue, ah<br>
Not a fortune-teller, but I can see into the future better<br>
Ain't no tellin' what'll happen when I pick up the microphone, get the fans together<br>
Same style, but the songs are better<br>
Been a year and a half, feels like it's gone forever<br>
Ain't no drink in my hand, but you know the buzz is comin'<br>
Big steps in the game, yeah, the Hulk is running<br>
My thoughts are funny, feels like I'm on to something, yeah<br>
I'm high off the music, my head's in the clouds<br>
I kinda like it up here, I am not comin' down<br>
I'd rather be alone, I am not good in crowds<br>
Which is kinda confusin', I've not been that way since I was a child<br>
They laughin', they tell me I'll never get out<br>
I'm just tryna be me, I am nobody else<br>
I don't care what you think, I'm just bein' myself<br>
So I guess for now<br>
I'll just be the outcast<br>
I'll just be the outcast<br>
I'll just be the outcast<br>
I guess I'll be the outcast<br>
Yeah, I guess I don't fit the mold of rap<br>
'Cause I'm respectin' women<br>
"I heard your record, I was laughin at it"<br>
Maybe they would like me more if I got a little graphic with it<br>
Nah, I don't wanna blend in with you little rappin' idiots, I'd rather be the outcast<br>
I ain't never puttin' out trash<br>
I take a hundred and staple it right to my tongue<br>
I always put the money where my mouth's at, ah<br>
Feels good to be here now<br>
I'm a weird person with a weird crowd<br>
What, you don't like that?
That's cool, that's great, that's fine, okay, you can leave now<br>
Got a weird smile, but I like it though<br>
I paint it on me and I'm walkin' to the microphone<br>
And put the caution tape around me like I did in Intro I, yeah<br>
Yeah, they got me reminiscin' now!<br>
You done know I'm 'bout to go mad<br>
Never wanted something so bad<br>
Goosebumps through the whole track<br>
Ain't no way I'm gonna hold back<br>
Got me thinkin' that I'm cookin' in a meth lab<br>
I don't blow it up in front of my own eyes<br>
You look a little lost, you ain't get that?<br>
Comin' from a town where nobody hears a rap like this<br>
I never get the memo, must've missed that<br>
Wow<br>
Here I go in my feelings again, I can feel it again<br>
So I lay in my bed, in my cell with the pen<br>
And I dwell on my sins, I keep wonderin' when<br>
Time to open the the doors, they don't know who I am<br>
But I pick up the keys and I put on my Timbs<br>
And I stare at the locks and the tat on my skin<br>
And I think to myself, "I don't wanna fit in"<br>
I'm high off the music, my head's in the clouds<br>
I kinda like it up here, I am not comin' down<br>
I'd rather be alone, I am not good in crowds<br>
Which is kinda confusin', I've not been that way since I was a child<br>
They laughin', they tell me I'll never get out<br>
I'm just tryna be me, I am nobody else<br>
I don't care what you think, I'm just bein' myself<br>
So I guess for now<br>
Yeah, I'll just be the outcast<br>
I'll just be the outcast<br>
I'll just be the outcast<br>
I guess I'll be the outcast<br>
Yeah, tryna focus<br>
Take a knife to my head then I cut it open<br>
Take my brain, put it on the floor tryna figure out my motives<br>
Y'all thought I was an issue when the door was locked<br>
Nah, you should see me when the door opens<br>
Every night I can hear voices<br>
Put a camera in my face, might turn Joker like I'm Mike Posner<br>
Always been a little complex<br>
Difficult to process<br>
Some of y'all wanna sit around and try to pick apart my bars<br>
Here's some lines you could dissect<br>
If I'ma die, I'ma die givin' everything that I have<br>
Take a deep breath, I don't need y'all's respect<br>
I'm a reject kid at recess playin' games with his make-believe friends<br>
Yeah, I don't ever take a night off<br>
Lights off in the room and I write songs<br>
I might fall into my thoughts once in a while when the mic's off<br>
You ain't ever seen no drive like mine, better hop outta my car<br>
I'm about to unlock my doors<br>
You ain't got a seat belt on, better find one<br>
Gettin' sick of people tellin' me to smile more<br>
T.S. was a chapter I'll never forget, it was therapy for me<br>
But it's time to turn the page now<br>
Hey, shut up! I'm tryna tell 'em my story!<br>
I'm sorry, I wasn't yellin' at y'all, I was talkin' to the voices<br>
I rip out the drums of the industry's ears for tryin' to ignore me <br>
And playin' while singin' this chorus<br>
I'll just be the outcast<br>
I'll just be the outcast<br>
I'll just be the outcast<br>
I guess I'll be the outcast<br>
I'll just be the outcast<br>
I'll just be the outcast<br>
I'll just be the outcast<br>
I guess I'll be the outcast<br></p></li>
	
	

	<li><span class="text1p">10 Feet Down</span>
	
	<p>Yeah I know the person in the mirror's not a perfect one<br>
I look at him everyday and think he's not enough<br>
My life's a book that I don't really like to open up<br>
I'm twenty-six, but I feel like I live in chapter one<br>
I skim through, I've been through it, they laugh at us<br>
You think it's funny, yeah, laugh it up<br>
I always felt like no one listened to me, that's how I grew up<br>
Church is where I found God, but it's also where I learned to judge<br>
Yeah, I had to learn there's a difference between<br>
What you want, and what you really need<br>
I've always been motivated by comments from people tellin' me<br>
Things that I'll never be, and then I become it, this is my everything<br>
There's so much that goes on in my head that people will never see<br>
You probably be terrified of my memories, don't lecture me<br>
Let me be, let me see, let me breathe, how they remember me<br>
Doesn't alter who I am as a person to take my energy, yeah<br>
Hard days, cold nights<br>
Staring down at an empty cup like<br>
I'ma fill, I'ma fill it up<br>
All day, all night<br>
Ten feet down nearly my whole life<br>
But I'll be rising, rising up<br>
Yeah, my fans made me who I am, but they also deceived me<br>
I've been allowed to live life like I'm already grieving<br>
I'm at a table of lies, but don't eat what they feed me<br>
My hoodie over my face, so nobody can see me<br>
I'm on a plane, 'bout to fly again<br>
Looking out the window, take a moment to admire it<br>
Wondering how high it is, wonder where the time has went<br>
Then I shut the window and go back to feeling like I'm out my mind again, ah<br>
Yeah, seems like we're all trying to climb a ladder<br>
It's crazy what we'll do to climb it faster<br>
It's like we throw away the things in life that really matter<br>
Just so that we can make it to the top, and wonder what we're even climbing after<br>
I know the feeling of feeling like everything you deal with will never change<br>
That's part of being a human, yeah<br>
Life's what you make of it, take it, embrace it, and take it, and savor it<br>
Ain't about what you did, it's what you became from it, ah<br>
Hard days, cold nights<br>
Staring down at an empty cup like<br>
I'ma fill, I'ma fill it up<br>
All day, all night<br>
Ten feet down nearly my whole life<br>
But I'll be rising, rising up<br>
We all want what we never had<br>
The good life doesn't seem so bad<br>
The good life doesn't seem so sad<br>
Yeah we all want what we never had<br>
Hard days, cold nights<br>
Staring down at an empty cup like<br>
I'ma fill, I'ma fill it up<br>
All day, all night<br>
Ten feet down nearly my whole life<br>
But I'll be rising, rising up<br>
We all want what we never had<br>
The good life doesn't seem so bad<br>
The good life doesn't seem so sad<br>
Yeah we all want what we never had<br>
Hard days, cold nights<br>
Staring down at an empty cup like<br>
I'ma fill, I'ma fill it up</p></li>
	
	<li><span class="text1p">Green Lights</span>
	
<p>My name buzzin', ain't no way you could ignore it<br>
I did not come this far so they could ignore me<br>
I am not the one to say, "I'll do it in the mornin'"<br>
I'd rather get it done, don't focus on what's not important<br>
They try to talk to me like they been nothin' but supportive<br>
Appreciate the love, but do not show up on my doorstep<br>
If you ain't about that real, I suggest that you avoid me<br>
If we ain't on the same page, that's the end of story, agh!<br>
Hey, you are not a baller 'cause your closet's full of Jordan's<br>
You are not a rich man 'cause you're on the Forbes list<br>
First, I dropped a record, then you know I gotta tour it<br>
Real's still the slogan, only difference is there's more of us<br>
The story of my life feels like it's just beginnin' now<br>
I ask you a question, I want answers, not the run-around<br>
You the one that brought it up, but I'm the one to shut it down<br>
If you ain't got the album yet, I brought you one, I'm at your house<br>
Hey!<br>
All I see is green lights (woo!)<br>
All I see is green lights <br>
All I spit is real life <br>
Bet you don't know what that's like (huh?)<br>
All I see is green lights (woo!)<br>
All I see is green lights (woo!) yeah<br>
All I spit is real life<br>
I bet you don't know what that's like<br>
I know where I'm goin', I don't let no one distract me<br>
I don't need directions from nobody in the back seat<br>
I don't need these people in my corner tryna gas me<br>
I'd rather have people in my corner tryna check me<br>
Yeah, I walk off the bus a different city than the last week<br>
Let the fans speak, they gon' tell you 'bout the past me<br>
If I'm bein' honest, last year I was in a bad place<br>
Wouldn't say I'm out of it, but don't feel like I can't be, agh!<br>
Who you know droppin' clean records, but they nasty?<br>
I was made for this, I could tell when Mama had me<br>
I hopped right off the table, told my doctor, "I ain't average"<br>
He asked me, "What does that mean?" I told him, "Get the pen and pad, please"<br>
Who'd a known I'd write something that could change lives?<br>
I don't think y'all fully understand the way you changed mine<br>
I look at the future that's in front of me with both eyes<br>
Three records, three years, I don't like to waste time<br>
All I see is green lights, yeah! (yeah) (woo!)<br>
All I see is green lights, haha!<br>
All I spit is real life (real life)<br>
Bet you don't know what that's like (you don't know!)<br>
All I see is green lights (green lights) woo!<br>
All I see is green lights (green lights—haha), yeah!<br>
All I spit is real life (oh, real life!)<br>
I bet you don't know what that's like (no!)<br>
Hey!<br>
All I see is—green lights!<br>
Yeah!<br>
Oh my!<br>
Yeah!<br></p></li>
	
	<li><span class="text1p">Dreams</span>
	
	<p>Yeah, most of my life's full of sad days<br>
Started at a young age<br>
Yeah, bought a house but I've been livin' on stage<br>
Tryna find the real me, I ain't found it yet<br>
Wake up every morning feelin' like I'm guilty<br>
Talk to God, "Can you hear me?"<br>
Lately, I'm a mess<br>
I don't want no one to help me<br>
Yeah, I don't want no one to help me and<br>
If you think I make decisions based off of what you think, then you're wrong<br>
Can't nobody think for me, I got my own thoughts<br>
Sometimes you don't know what you had until it's all gone, 'til it's all gone<br>
If I took the hand that was dealt me then I would be nowhere in life<br>
Yeah, I had to think smart<br>
Threw away the deck and got my own cards<br>
Long before I had the money to afford a car<br>
I–I've been doin' me<br>
I've been doin' me<br>
Yeah, I've been doin' me<br>
I've been doin' me<br>
Followin' my dreams<br>
Yeah, I've been doin' me<br>
I've been doin' me<br>
I've been doin' me<br>
Yeah, I've been doin' me<br>
I've been doin' me<br>
Followin' my dreams<br>
Yeah, I've been doin' me<br>
Most of my life's full of regrets<br>
Things I wanna take back, yeah<br>
Wrote you a letter, wish that I had never sent that<br>
Didn't even make sense, I don't even know<br>
All I know is I get lower on the weekends<br>
They tell me I should make friends, I just sit at home<br>
Lately, I've been off the deep end, yeah<br>
I've been off the deep end and<br>
If you think that I'm 'bout to change who I am just for you then you're so wrong<br>
As I kid I built a house around my broke cars<br>
Sometimes you don't know what you had until it falls apart, 'til it falls apart<br>
If I took the hand that was dealt me then I would be nowhere in life<br>
Yeah, I had to think smart<br>
Threw away the deck and got my own cards<br>
Long before I had the money to afford a car<br>
I've been doin' me (oh)<br>
I've been doin' me<br>
Yeah, I've been doin' me (I have been)<br>
I've been doin' me<br>
Followin' my dreams<br>
Yeah, I've been doin' me (followin' my)<br>
I've been doin' me<br>
I've been doin' me (I've been followin' my)<br>
Yeah, I've been doin' me<br>
Followin' my dreams<br>
Yeah, I'm just doin' me<br>
Yeah, I'm just doin' me<br>
Yeah, I'm reminiscin' back to both of us laughin'<br>
Playin' old records thinkin' every one of 'em's classic<br>
Windows down, we on the street up in Michigan rappin'<br>
We talked about it, but never really knew it could happen<br>
My confidence about as low as the gas is<br>
We didn't have the money for it, so we'd turn the key backwards <br>
And sit in parking lots for hours 'til the battery crashes<br>
I think that we related 'cause both of us were lookin' for answers<br>
A couple months ago I drove into Gladwin, got me all in my feelings<br>
It's somethin' 'bout bein' somewhere that's familiar<br>
Pull in the gas station, open up the tank then I fill it then laugh<br>
Would I move back? Mm, not in a million, but I appreciate the memories that we had<br>
I know you've been callin', sorry I never call back<br>
I know I've been distant, you know I never meant that<br>
You can tell the family how I'm doing if they ask<br>
I'm just doin' me<br></p></li>
	
	
	<li><span class="text1p">Let You Down</span>
	
	
	<p>Feels like we're on the edge right now<br>
I wish that I could say I'm proud<br>
I'm sorry that I let you down<br>
Let you down<br>
All these voices in my head get loud<br>
I wish that I could shut them out<br>
I'm sorry that I let you down<br>
L-l-let you down<br>
Yeah, I guess I'm a disappointment<br>
Doing everything I can, I don't wanna make you disappointed<br>
It's annoying<br>
I just wanna make you feel like everything I ever did wasn't ever tryna make an issue for you<br>
But, I guess the more you<br>
Thought about everything, you were never even wrong in the first place, right?<br>
Yeah, I'ma just ignore you<br>
Walking towards you, with my head down, lookin' at the ground, I'm embarrassed for you<br>
Paranoia, what did I do wrong this time? That's parents for you<br>
Very loyal?<br>
Shoulda had my back, but you put a knife in it, my hands are full<br>
What else should I carry for you?<br>
I cared for you, but<br>
Feels like we're on the edge right now<br>
I wish that I could say I'm proud<br>
I'm sorry that I let you down<br>
L-l-let you down<br>
All these voices in my head get loud<br>
I wish that I could shut them out<br>
I'm sorry that I let you down<br>
L-l-let you down<br>
Yeah, you don't wanna make this work<br>
You just wanna make this worse<br>
Want me to listen to you<br>
But you don't ever hear my words<br>
You don't wanna know my hurt, yet<br>
Let me guess you want an apology, probably<br>
How can we keep going at a rate like this?<br>
We can't, so I guess I'ma have to leave<br>
Please don't come after me<br>
I just wanna be alone right now, I don't really wanna think at all<br>
Go ahead, just drink it off<br>
Both know you're gonna call tomorrow like nothing's wrong<br>
Ain't that what you always do?<br>
I feel like every time I talk to you, you're in an awful mood<br>
What else can I offer you?<br>
There's nothing left right now, I gave it all to you<br>
Feels like we're on the edge right now<br>
I wish that I could say I'm proud<br>
I'm sorry that I let you down<br>
L-l-let you down<br>
All these voices in my head get loud<br>
I wish that I could shut them out<br>
I'm sorry that I let you down<br>
L-l-let you down<br>
Yeah, don't talk down to me<br>
That's not gonna work now<br>
Packed all my clothes and I moved out<br>
I don't even wanna go to your house<br>
Everytime I sit on that couch<br>
I feel like you lecture me<br>
Eventually, I bet that we<br>
Could have made this work and probably woulda figured things out<br>
But I guess that I'm a letdown<br>
But it's cool, I checked out<br>
Oh, you wanna be friends now?<br>
Okay, let's put my fake face on and pretend now<br>
Sit around and talk about the good times<br>
That didn't even happen<br>
I mean, why are you laughing?<br>
Must have missed that joke<br>
Let me see if I can find a reaction<br>
No, but at least you're happy<br>
Feels like we're on the edge right now<br>
I wish that I could say I'm proud<br>
I'm sorry that I let you down<br>
Oh, I let you down<br>
All these voices in my head get loud<br>
And I wish that I could shut them out<br>
I'm sorry that I let you down<br>
Oh, let you down<br>
I'm sorry<br>
I'm so sorry now<br>
I'm sorry<br>
That I let you down<br></p></li>
	
	
	
	<li><span class="text1p">Destiny</span>
	
	
	<p>I talk to God like, "What's next for me?"<br>
I'm just fulfillin' my destiny<br>
Fulfillin' my destiny, yeah<br>
I talk to God like, "What's next for me?"<br>
I'm just fulfillin' my destiny<br>
I'm just fulfillin' my destiny, yeah<br>
I told y'all I'm a psycho<br>
Ain't no tellin' what I might do, yeah<br>
Doubt put his hands around my throat, so I cut 'em off<br>
That's what you get for steppin' on my toes<br>
At the top of the key, that's an iso<br>
My career about to take off, flight mode<br>
You don't like where we're headed, what you sittin' on my flight for, huh?<br>
Yeah, they said, "Wait until your time comes"<br>
Nope! Time's up<br>
You put in the album, got you thinkin' it's your birthday, woo!<br>
Yeah, I'm full of surprises<br>
A lot of pressure on the records and you know I'm makin' diamonds<br>
Tell me, how would you define this?<br>
You witnessin' the finest<br>
Yeah, you never know what you can do until you try it<br>
I been workin' late nights like I'm Letterman<br>
He ain't workin' anymore? Well forget it then<br>
Somebody get the sedatives<br>
Too late, yeah the lightbulb's off in my head again<br>
Where is Edison for my adrenaline<br>
Rushin' through my veins like it's never did<br>
What good is the body, man, if you ain't got the head with it<br>
Since a kid up I've been a pessimist<br>
I like to focus on the negatives, oh Lord!<br>
I talk to God like, "What's next for me?"<br>
I'm just fulfillin' my destiny (all day)<br>
Yeah, my pops told me he was proud, I don't think he knew what that meant to me<br>
Yeah, you try to take advantage of me before you die, you'll be dead to me (all day)<br>
Before you die, you'll be dead to me<br>
Laugh when they question me, y'all ain't no threat to me, yeah<br>
I'm just fulfillin' my destiny<br>
I'm just fulfillin' my destiny<br>
To the death of me, I'm just fulfillin' my destiny<br>
I'm just fulfillin' my destiny<br>
I'm just fulfillin' my destiny (all day)<br>
To the death of me, I'm just fulfillin' my destiny<br>
Yeah, you know I keep it real honest<br>
Real topics, ain't no way I will stop it<br>
Chills watching everything that's going on around me, they wonder if I still got it<br>
I'm still rhymin', just another day in paradise, Phil Collins<br>
'Til you put your hands on me, yeah, now we got a real problem<br>
Pay homage, make comments<br>
We in the same genre, but I can guarantee we don't put out the same product<br>
Get away from me, there ain't nothing you can say to me<br>
Tried to roll my name through the dirt, that's fine, I was made from it<br>
You ain't made it 'til they printin' shirts with your face on it<br>
Outside tryna sell 'em at your shows, those are fake, dummy<br>
This is something can't nobody ever take from me<br>
No mistakin' me, take a blade to me, take a vein from me<br>
Let me know what you get when you pull the DNA from me, woo!<br>
No matches, I've been the baddest, no way to match it<br>
You never seen the passion that's even half this<br>
I'm wreakin' havoc<br>
I think the fact that you think I'm average is kinda madness<br>
So quit your naggin', you couldn't fathom what I've imagined<br>
Forget the mansion, I'm in the attic<br>
It's pretty graphic, but had to happen<br>
You won't see it, get your glasses, forget the status<br>
Yeah, I feel like we might be on the come up (all day)<br>
Knew I was a problem how I showed up<br>
Did not have to sell out, but the show does (all day)<br>
They ask me why I do it, so I told 'em (yeah)<br>
I'm just fulfillin' my destiny<br>
I'm just fulfillin' my destiny (all day)<br>
To the death of me, I'm just fulfillin' my destiny<br>
I'm just fulfillin' my destiny<br>
I'm just fulfillin' my destiny (all day)<br>
To the death of me, I'm just fulfillin' my destiny<br>
I'm just fulfillin' my destiny<br>

To the death of me, I'm just fulfillin' my destiny<br>

To the death of me, I'm just fulfillin' my destiny<br></p></li>
	
	<li><span class="text1p">My Life</span>
	
	
	<p>Yeah, look<br>
I mean this with love when I say it<br>
I wanna answer the phone when you call me<br>
The problem is, it's 10 a.M. And you're already drinkin'<br>
You're probably already wasted<br>
What's the point in having conversation with somebody that<br>
Won't remember we had conversations, yeah, we always talk about the same things<br>
We just say 'em different<br>
Try to fix it, crazy, isn't it?<br>
You say, "Mom was always proud" and played the videos of us as kids, I get it<br>
I think that both of us live in the past, so we take for granted the present<br>
Maybe next time I'm in Michigan, I'll come and visit<br>
We ain't got a lot in common but both of us miss her<br>
We could sit inside your smoke-filled livin' room, and tear up together, that's real<br>
I might do some things you don't like<br>
We all make mistakes, that's just life<br>
They might say I changed, that's alright<br>
That's alright, that's alright<br>
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life<br>
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life<br>
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life<br>
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life<br>
My life, my life<br>
You know my patience is very thin<br>
Wish I was there again<br>
I'm not embarrassed to say that we've always had issues<br>
I'm embarrassed to say that we never took care of 'em, yeah<br>
Pain will always find its way to the surface<br>
No matter how deep you bury him<br>
Growin' up, I felt like no one ever really got me, eventually<br>
I took that out on relationships (woo)<br>
I put my arm around you, and I mean it, I love you to death<br>
These are the moments I know I'ma always hold onto and cherish 'em, yeah<br>
Life's about taking chances, making moves<br>
Not about what you did, it's what you do<br>
Build on what you got and learn from what you lose<br>
And never let people distract you from being you<br>
I might do some things you don't like<br>
We all make mistakes, that's just life<br>
They might say I changed, that's alright<br>
That's alright, that's alright<br>
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life<br>
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life<br>
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life<br>
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life<br>
My life, my life<br>
That's just my, that's just my, that's just my<br>
That's just my, that's just my, that's just my<br>
That's just my, that's just my, that's just my<br>
(Oh no no no) Yeah<br>
That's just my, that's just my, that's just my<br>
That's just my, that's just my, that's just my<br>
That's just my, that's just my, that's just my<br>
Life<br>
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life<br>
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life<br>
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life<br>

	<li><span class="text1p">You're Special</span>


<p>Yeah, you, baby, you<br>
You're something special<br>
Baby, I know<br>
I know what you're thinkin'<br>
Maybe, maybe I'm wasting your time<br>
But I promise, but I promise<br>
I know that I go back and forth<br>
But I won't let you, I won't let you, I won't let you down<br>
Yeah<br>
I meant it when I told you I would change<br>
Meant it when I told you I would stay<br>
Sick of talkin' on the phone, babe<br>
Time to pack your car and come to my state<br>
Come to my place, look at my face, oh, yeah<br>
You know I ain't playin'<br>
I'll send you some money, yeah, hop in the car<br>
And get on the road, here we go<br>
Baby, I can't lie<br>
I'm a little bit, I'm a little bit scared right now, girl, girl, yeah<br>
You said you want more<br>
And I can't blame you for<br>
Askin' me what's somethin' you deserve<br>
You're special<br>
Yo-yo-you're special<br>
Oh yeah, you're special<br>
Yo-yo-you're special<br>
Yeah, I knew it, you was my type<br>
We ain't gotta skip to the highlight<br>
You're the highlight, girl, of my life (woo)<br>
Both of us have got a past, but it's alright<br>
All night car rides<br>
Drivin' through the city, yeah, the view's fantastic<br>
It's automatic, could see you smile, gotta have it<br>
She got me thinkin' maybe I'ma have to put a ring on it, girl<br>
I ain't never been a romantic, but I can romance ya'<br>
Get your shoes on, baby, I am not asking<br>
I'm 'bout to take you out to dinner, put the black dress on<br>
Got the room gaspin', how did this happen?<br>
I don't even know<br>
She's the type to sing my words at the show<br>
She's the type to pick me up when I'm low<br>
And remind me she got my back, no matter what<br>
Yeah, I think she hearin' me now<br>
Say what I think, so I'm thinkin' out loud<br>
I need a woman I know I can trust, and I got one<br>
I guess you can say that she down<br>
Callin' my phone, and she told me she proud<br>
She said my name and I like how that sounds, oh, yeah<br>
(I like that)<br>
I like how this sounds<br>
(Baby, I, yeah)<br>
Baby, don't make me lose myself<br>
I need somebody I know I can trust (yeah)<br>
I mean, I'm being honest<br>
I ain't ever met a girl like you (no)<br>
Baby, you can call me<br>
You can call me anytime<br>
You can call me any day, anytime<br>
You know I'ma answer<br>
I won't let you, I won't let you down, yeah<br>
You said you want more<br>
And I can't blame you for<br>
Askin' me for somethin' you deserve (You deserve it)<br>
You're special, yeah<br>
Yo-yo-you're special<br>
I said, girl, I said, you're special<br>
I said, you're special	<br></p></li>
	
	
	<li><span class="text1p">If You Want Love</span>
	
	
	<p>I just need some time, I'm tryna think straight<br>
I just need a moment in my own space<br>
Ask me how I'm doin', I'll say "okay, " yeah   <br>                 
But ain't that what we all say?<br>
Sometimes I think back to the old days<br>
In the pointless conversations with the old me<br>
Yeah, back when my momma used to hold me<br>
I wish somebody woulda told me<br>
If you want love, you gon' have to go through the pain<br>
If you want love, you gon' have to learn how to change<br>
If you want trust, you gon' have to give some away<br>
If you want love, if you want love<br>
Yeah, as a kid I used to think life<br>
Is moving so slow, I watch it go by<br>
Look out the window on my bus ride<br>
I thought the world was so small, through my closed eyes<br>
I've always tried to control things<br>
In the end that's what controls me<br>
Maybe that's why I'm controllin'<br>
I wish somebody woulda told me<br>
If you want love, you gon' have to go through the pain<br>
If you want love, you gon' have to learn how to change<br>
If you want trust, you gon' have to give some away<br>
If you want love, if you want love<br>
The older I get, I feel like I'm always tryna save time<br>
Talkin' to the voices in my head, they make me think twice<br>
Tellin' me it doesn't mean it's wrong because it feels right<br>
I'm scared that one day I wake up and wonder where the time go<br>
Talk about the past like it's the present while I rock slow<br>
I'll sit in the living room and laugh with kids of my own<br>
And tell 'em<br>
If you want love, you gon' have to go through the pain<br>
I wish you woulda told me<br>
If you want love, you gon' have to learn how to change<br>
I wish somebody woulda told me<br>
If you want trust, you gon' have to give some away<br>
You gon' have to give<br>
If you want love, if you want love<br>
If you want love, if you want love<br></p></li>
	
	
	
	<li><span class="text1p">Remember This</span>
	
	
	<p>Yeah, they say when we grow up<br>
You'll understand when you're older<br>
Guess I'm still a kid, I don't know it<br>
If I'll ever let go of this (yeah)<br>
Say goodbye to the old me<br>
We ain't friends anymore, you don't know me (real music)<br>
I know I could die any moment<br>
If I do just remember this<br>
Yeah, handouts create lazy people I'm not impressed with<br>
You want something in life, then why don't you go and get it?<br>
Actions speak louder than words do, it's pretty quiet, isn't it?<br>
Look at the world we live in, defined by comment sections<br>
Surround yourself with people that challenge how you think<br>
Not people that nod their head and act like they agree<br>
Those people will cut you open just to watch you bleed<br>
Always be yourself, not the person that you pretend to be, no!<br>
These people gon' tell you that you will never make it<br>
Then when you do, they gon' say they knew you were goin' places<br>
That's just how it works, next thing you know you'll be overrated<br>
Hearing people say they miss the "old you, " it's crazy, ain't it?<br>
And perfect people don't exist, so don't pretend to be one<br>
I don't need pats on the back from people for my achievements<br>
When I die I wanna know that I lived for a reason<br>
Anyone can take your life, but not what you believe in, no<br>
Yeah, they say when we grow up<br>
You'll understand when you're older<br>
Guess I'm still a kid, I don't know it<br>
If I'll ever let go of this<br>
Say goodbye to the old me<br>
We ain't friends anymore, you don't know me<br>
I know I could die any moment<br>
If I do just remember this<br>
Yeah, don't take opinions from people that won't listen to yours<br>
If money's where you find happiness, you'll always be poor<br>
If you don't like the job you have, then what do you do it for?<br>
The cure to pain isn't something you buy at liquor stores, nah<br>
The real you is not defined by the size of your office<br>
The real you is who you are when ain't nobody watchin'<br>
You spend your whole life worried about what's in your wallet<br>
For what? That money won't show up in your coffin, woo!<br>
Yeah, anger's a liar, he ain't got no respect<br>
I fell in love with my pain and I slept with my regrets<br>
Happiness saw it happen, maybe that's why she up and left<br>
Joy called me a cheater, said she ain't coming back<br>
I've always had a problem with relationships<br>
But that's what happens when you see the world through a broken lens<br>
Mistakes can make you grow, that doesn't mean you're friends<br>
Who you are is up to you, don't leave it up to them, no<br>
Yeah, they say when we grow up<br>
You'll understand when you're older<br>
Guess I'm still a kid, I don't know it<br>
If I'll ever let go of this<br>
Say goodbye to the old me<br>
We ain't friends anymore, you don't know me<br>
I know I could die any moment<br>
If I do just remember this<br>
Yeah, they say you got into music, you signed up to be hated<br>
That's kinda weird cause I don't remember signing my name up<br>
Coming from people that give advice but never take none<br>
I like my privacy, but, lately, I feel it's invaded<br>
I heard that life's too short, don't let it pass you by<br>
We waste a lot of time crying over wasted time<br>
It's not about what people think, it's how you feel inside<br>
My biggest failures in life are knowing I never tried, woo!<br>
I look at the world from a different angle<br>
People change, even Satan used to be an angel<br>
Think twice before you're bitin' on the hand that made you<br>
Don't believe what you believe just 'cause that's how they raised you<br>
Think your own thoughts, don't let them do it for you<br>
Say you want a drink, don't wait for people to pour it on you<br>
Cut out the lies, stay close to the people you know are loyal<br>
Grab your own glass and fill it, don't let your fear destroy you, woo!<br></p></li>
	
	<li><span class="text1p">Know</span>

<p>I wanna know, I wanna know<br>
I wanna know, I wanna know<br>
Been sick with the pen since I was ten inches tall<br>
I'm relentless, you guessed it, back with the vengeance<br>
In the set list, every sentence so raw you can sense it<br>
No question, tryna be the best that<br>
Ever walked this Earth, if I'm not, then I'm next up<br>
Dressed up like I'm 'bout to hit a bank or somethin'<br>
Yeah, I am not the one you wanna mess with, no!<br>
When I come into the room, put your heads down<br>
I'm a little bit TØP, Stressed Out<br>
What does that mean?<br>
I'm a rap fiend with a bad lead<br>
You could run if you want, but you'll never catch me<br>
So cold with it, y'all don't get it<br>
Let you put me in a cage just so I can open it<br>
Handcuffed, hands up, this is dope to me<br>
Oh, you thought you had me captured? So funny<br>
Better run from me <br>
I don't think you really understand what this does for me<br>
I dress bummy, but I clean up nice <br>
They ain't never seen this side of me<br>
Long T-shirt, they eyein' me<br>
Rules don't apply to me<br>
You better give me my privacy<br>
I got the fans I got because I'm takin' them behind the scenes<br>
You played hide-and-seek, I played hide-from-me, agh!<br>
Yeah, look at all that we accomplished<br>
Quittin' for me's not an option<br>
I wanna look at my kids in the face when I'm older <br>
And say I've been something admirable<br>
Fast checks, fast women, that don't inspire me, no!<br>
You don't wanna know what's goin' on inside my personal life? <br>
Then get out my diary, yeah<br>
I wanna know what it's like to be happy<br>
I wanna know what it's like to wake up in the morning <br>
And feel like it's real when I'm laughin' (yeah!)<br>
I wanna know what it's like to sit down with my friends <br>
And feel like they might understand me (woo!)<br>
I wanna know that the people around me care less about Grammys and more about family<br>
I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know (Yeah, yeah!)<br>
I wanna know, I wanna know<br>
I wanna know, I wanna know (Yeah, I wanna know)<br>
I wanna know, I wanna know<br>
Yeah, record labels' signin' artists <br>
They ain't got a clue what to do with<br>
Why would I put my career in the hands <br>
Of someone that don't even know what they doin'?<br>
Why would I sit in a room full of people <br>
That don't even care about me <br>
Or my future and tell me they ain't really feelin' the vision<br>
Then hop on the wagon the moment it's movin', huh?<br>
Heard you tellin' people you don't really like the content<br>
Whatchu wanna hear me rap about?<br>
How I'm on a roll gettin' side chicks?<br>
You should treat your mouth like your phone in a movie theater<br>
Put that on silence<br>
I don't care what everybody else is doin' <br>
I'm just bein' me and that's not how I live<br>
Oh my, oh my, yeah, I'm in the zone now<br>
Zoned out, come to my show with they phones out<br>
Whole crowd, oh wow, that's wild, tone down, no!<br>
I have created my own style<br>
I have created my own sound<br>
Oh, you didn't know? Well, you know it now<br>
Slowin' down<br>
Livin' happy, this is what I was made for<br>
They say you get what you paid for<br>
Grandpa told me, "Always look to Heaven <br>
Try to pay attention when you talkin' to God, " yeah<br>
I wish I'd paid more, I shoulda prayed more<br>
Everybody's out here shoppin' <br>
Tryna find a different product in the same stores<br>
Everybody wants they dream to fall in they lap<br>
But don't wanna work for it<br>
I've been doin' this since I was just a kid <br>
And mama bought me 8 Mile at the movie store<br>
Hopin' someday maybe I could do what I love <br>
For a livin' with people I care for<br>
People that care more about me as person <br>
Than money I make for 'em, yeah!<br>
I wanna know what it's like to be happy<br>
I wanna know what it's like to wake up in the morning <br>
And feel like it's real when I'm laughin' (yeah!)<br>
I wanna know what it's like to sit down with my friends <br>
And feel like they might understand me (woo!)<br>
I wanna know that the people around me care less <br>
About Grammys and more about family<br>
I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know (Woo! Yo!)<br>
I wanna know, I wanna know (Yeah, I wanna know)<br>
I wanna know, I wanna know<br>
I wanna know, I wanna know (Woo!)<br>
I wanna know, I wanna know (Woo! Yeah!)<br>
I wanna know, I wanna know (Yeah, I wanna know)<br>
I wanna know, I wanna know (Yeah, I wanna know)<br>
I wanna know, I wanna know<br></p></li>
	
	<li><span class="text1p">Lie</span>
	
	<p>I heard you told your friends that I'm just not your type<br>
If that's how you really feel, then why'd you call last night?<br>
You say all I ever do is just control your life<br>
But how you gonna lie like that, how you gonna lie like that?<br>
Yeah, I heard you said I ain't the type for you<br>
I don't regret it though, I learned from it<br>
They should have you locked up for all the time you stole from us<br>
Took you out when I had no money<br>
Only person that you ever cared about was you, that's why it's so funny<br>
You want somebody that'll keep you warm at night, then tell me, why you actin' cold to me?<br>
You ain't the only one to blame, no<br>
I'm the one that made you rich when I bought every lie you sold to me<br>
Yeah, heard you threw away the pictures<br>
But you still got the memories of us, so I guess that don't really make a difference<br>
Flippin' through 'em in your head<br>
Got you texting me all hours any night<br>
Yeah, you told me that you needed distance<br>
What's the deal with you?<br>
You say you want a man that keeps it real<br>
Then why you mad when I get real with you?<br>
You want someone to pay the bills for you<br>
Went from feelin' you, now I feel for you, liar<br>
I heard you told your friends that I'm just not your type<br>
If that's how you really feel, then why'd you call last night?<br>
You say all I ever do is just control your life<br>
But how you gonna lie like that, how you gonna lie like that?<br>
Look, let me guess, you want to stay friends?<br>
Tellin' people that's how we been?<br>
Tellin' everybody, yeah that we was barely speakin'<br>
All this kinda funny, why'd you call me every day then?<br>
It's immaturity, you goin' off the deep end<br>
You just want somebody you can chill and get some drinks with, cool<br>
Then don't hit me on the weekend, tellin' me <br>
You missed the way we talked and how I listen, yeah<br>
Why you playin' with my mind, huh?<br>
Why you playin' with my time, huh?<br>
Told me we should let it go and put it all behind us<br>
That's what I did, now you askin' me what I done, I was<br>
Waitin' for this day, I saw it comin'<br>
I think you just like attention, tryna tell me all your problems<br>
I got issues of my own, I ain't got time for all this drama<br>
You told me that you don't really wanna talk, then why you callin', huh?<br>
I heard you told your friends that I'm just not your type<br>
If that's how you really feel, then why'd you call last night?<br>
You say all I ever do is just control your life<br>
But how you gonna lie like that, how you gonna lie like that?<br>
How you gonna lie, how you gonna lie like that?<br>
Baby how you gonna lie, how you gonna lie like that?<br>
How you gonna lie, baby, how you gonna lie like that?<br>
No, no, how you gonna lie like that?<br>
I heard you told your friends that I'm just not your type<br>
If that's how you really feel, then why'd you call last night?<br>
You say all I ever do is just control your life<br>
But how you gonna lie like that, how you gonna lie like that?<br>
Tell me how you 'bout to lie like that<br>
Tell me how you 'bout to lie like that<br></p></li>
	
	<li><span class="text1p">3 A.M.</span>
	
	<p>Call me at 3 AM, telling me that I could be the one, oh yeah<br>
Maybe I was in love from the outside, guess I ain't what you want no more<br>
If you got someone else inside of your life, yeah, that's good for you, I'm happy<br>
You got someone that makes you smile more than I ever did, yeah that's great<br>
Listen, why they always tryna hurt me?<br>
Why they always tryna burn me?<br>
I swear to God, shoulda never even happened in the first place<br>
Only time you hit me's on my birthday<br>
Wish that I could tell you that I got a lot of love for you<br>
Wish that I could tell you I got trust for you<br>
Once you put some money in the bank, you understand that the money ain't enough for you<br>
Yeah, look what it's done to you<br>
Everyone's your friend when the music start buzzin'<br>
I'm closer to the people that were there when I was nothin'<br>
Tryna talk about the past but you always change the subject<br>
I ain't good at shakin' hands but I'm good at holdin' grudges<br>
Why you always frontin', huh, always tryna play wit' me?<br>
Yeah, whatchu gotta say to me?<br>
I am not a slave to the people writin' checks to me<br>
This is destiny, they ain't never had respect for me<br>
Call me at 3 AM, telling me that I could be the one, oh yeah<br>
Maybe I was in love from the outside, guess I ain't what you want no more<br>

You got someone that makes you smile more than I ever did, yeah that's great<br>
I don't like that!<br>

I don't like that!<br>
Why you actin' shady on me?<br>
Why you always tryna<br>
Why you always tryna play, I ain't got a clue right now<br>
Everything I ever wanted was someone, I'm watching them go<br>
Yeah, you said I'm scared for you<br>
Lemme say a prayer for you<br>
Hope you never make it to the top just to find out there ain't nothing there for you<br>
And now the people tryna tell you that they care for you, never cared for you<br>
First time that you ever told me that you loved me, I know that was probably weird for you<br>
'Cause I didn't say it back, I'm so caught up in the past, and I know it wasn't fair to you<br>
Maybe I don't see the world like I'm s'posed to<br>
Maybe I'm just living in a nightmare<br>
Maybe all the people that I thought that I was close to<br>
Wouldn't be around if it wasn't for my career<br>
Yeah, this third record doesn't pop off, how many people 'bout to drop off?<br>
I know how it works, if the record doesn't work, then it's my fault<br>
I'm in a room full of fans singin' my thoughts, my God, wooh!<br>
Call me at 3 AM, telling me that I could be the one, oh yeah<br>
Maybe I was in love from the oustide, guess I ain't what you want no more<br>
If you got someone else inside of your life, yeah, that's good for you, I'm happy<br>
You got someone that makes you smile more than I ever did, yeah that's great<br>
I don't like that!<br>
I don't like that, no! (I'm really sorry)<br>
I don't like that!<br>
Why you actin' shady on me?<br>
Why you always tryna<br>
Why you always tryna play, I ain't got a clue right now<br>
Everything I ever wanted was someone, I'm watching them go<br>
Yeah, yeah I'm done with that<br>
Reminiscing 'bout all we had<br>
We got nowhere to go, you got all the things you wanted<br>
Got everything that you wanted<br>
Yeah<br></p></li>
	
	
	<li><span class="text1p">One Hundred</span>

<p>Hey, I'm on a hundred right now<br>
Yeah<br>
They say the flow soundin' like a mixtape<br>
They ain't see it comin' like a fast break<br>
They ain't see it comin' like Jordan hittin' jumpers, yeah, they ask me<br>
"When that new music 'bout to drop?"<br>
Ain't that what I gave you last week? (Last week!)<br>
Yeah, oh, you done it now<br>
Feels like I'm coming up, but spit it like I'm underground<br>
Wonder how I come into your city like I run the town<br>
Love the sound<br>
Started on a stage, now we in the crowd, woo!<br>
Yeah, what's with the hype though?<br>
Told me that your record was the greatest, but you lied though<br>
Told me they consider you a God, yeah, well I don't<br>
Say you never lived until you found something to die for, woo!<br>
Yeah, and that is so true<br>
Forget the haters, remember people you're close to<br>
Now I'm doing things they told me I ain't supposed to<br>
They treat me like a player, that's funny, I'm here to coach you!<br>
Go back to the bench, know where you belong<br>
Say that you've been practicin', well maybe you should do it more<br>
Say that you the boss, yeah? Well, who did you employ?<br>
All these sucky rappers, I don't listen to them, so annoyed!<br>
I'm on a hundred!<br>
Yeah, I said I'm on a hundred right now, hey!<br>
We on a hundred!<br>
Yeah, I said we on a hundred right now, oh!<br>
I'm on a hundred!<br>
Yeah, I said I'm on a hundred right now, hey!<br>
We on a hundred!<br>
Yeah, I said we on a hundred right now, oh!<br>
Yeah, you shoulda left this on a high note<br>
Different cities, different time zones<br>
You had me open up for your tour<br>
I leave it lookin' like it's my show<br>
The fans beggin' for the encore, woo!<br>
Yeah, and what you know about<br>
Selling merchandise right out your house?<br>
I got forty boxes in my living room on the couch<br>
Yeah, me and my girl 'bout to ship them out, oh Lord!<br>
Yeah, yeah, I thought I told 'em last record<br>
I'm out here grindin' on a mad level<br>
Always on a hundred, they don't understand the mad hustle<br>
Nah, but that's what happens when the fans love you, I know!<br>
Yeah, I ain't the norm, but I like it though<br>
'Bout to move the family out to Nashville<br>
I'm sleepin' on the floor, got no curtains in the bedroom<br>
Hang up the sheets, yeah, that's the way that I roll!<br>
Yeah, they think the money 'bout to change me<br>
That type of talkin' got me angry, yeah<br>
A lot of people tryna play me<br>
Me and the fan base lookin' like the A-Team, woo<br>
How you tellin' people that we family?<br>
Hold up<br>
Yeah, when you ain't even met me<br>
That's the type of thing that may upset me<br>
That's the type of thing that may upset me<br>
I'm on a hundred! (Hundred)<br>
Yeah, I said I'm on a hundred right now, hey!<br>
We on a hundred! (On a hundred!)<br>
Yeah, I said we on a hundred right now, oh!<br>
I'm on a hundred!<br>
Yeah, I said I'm on a hundred right now, hey! (Woo!)<br>
We on a hundred!<br>
Yeah, I said we on a hundred right now, oh!<br>
I'm on a hundred!<br>
Yeah, I said I'm on a hundred right now, hey! (Woo!)<br>
We on a hundred!<br>
Yeah, I said we on a hundred right now, oh!<br>
We on a—we on a hundred right now!<br>
Boy!<br>
Yeagh!<br></p></li>
	
	
	<li><span class="text1p">Outro</span>
	
	<p>I'm dedicated, the definition of dedication<br>
Wrote this whole record while I was levitating<br>
Sittin' in my room with the pen and paper, I'm innovative<br>
They've been afraid of me since I was a second grader<br>
I'm the kid on the playground mama told you to never play with<br>
There's levels of music—and I'm in the elevator<br>
Going up to the top floor, look how we elevated<br>
What, you don't know the brand by now? You better get educated<br>
Take both of my arms, rip 'em out the sockets and separate 'em<br>
Forgive me, yeah, I know I get animated<br>
Don't matter, I still write a better record than yours without a hesitation<br>
Never been more motivated<br>
Just look at all the minds I have opened and penetrated<br>
See, I am the voice of all these kids that think things, but never say 'em<br>
That's why they come to my shows wearing the NF hoodies<br>
And hats low like we're carrying weapons, ah!<br>
Put the controllers away, it's game over<br>
I promise I'm way colder<br>
The fans keep saying that they're hungry for new music<br>
Well that's pretty convenient 'cause I just made a plate for 'em<br>
And now I'm hearing none of y'all are saying<br>
I just sit at the keys feeling the music<br>
Got me thinking I'm Beethoven<br>
The game needs a makeover<br>
If you've been waiting, the wait's over<br>
You ain't notice, y'all about to witness a takeover, I'm home!<br>
Yeah, they waiting on me to match the<br>
Emotion that I had in the last one<br>
What if I don't, they gon' tell me that I'm losing my passion?<br>
If I do, am I repeating my actions?<br>
Yeah, look, "How Could You Leave Us" is massive<br>
There ain't nothing I can write that'll match that<br>
My biggest fear writing this record wasn't putting out trash<br>
It was disappointing myself and the fanbase<br>
Now I want you to picture me<br>
I'm in a hotel rapping, crying on the floor of the bathroom<br>
Staring in the mirror, my room, hands shaking<br>
Playing "How Could You Leave Us" through the speakers on my iPhone<br>
Tryna to figure out if I'ma always feel the way that I feel<br>
Or maybe someday I can learn to be happy<br>
Or maybe I can't be, 'cause if the music ain't emotional enough<br>
Are they gon' call me a has-been?<br>
Pain's always been the root of my music<br>
If I cut it off, how am I supposed to keep growing<br>
If I let it go, won't my whole career be in ruins?<br>
That's when I realized this whole conversation is stupid<br>
I never cared to impress people that don't even know me<br>
I just write what I feel, somehow it started a movement<br>
Trying to enjoy a career, but I don't know how to do it<br>
When I spend all of time my being afraid I'ma lose it!<br>
But, then I figured out the reason they follow me<br>
The reason why these fans surrounding me<br>
It's not 'cause I'm a "Rap God"<br>
I don't need you people to bow to me<br>
All they ever did was doubt on me, now everyone's proud of me<br>
Acknowledge me or not, you ain't ignoring the following<br>
I'm just teaching 'em something they couldn't learn in they colleges<br>
This is for the kids feeling like they live at the bottom<br>
And every day of they lives, feels like it's darker than Halloween!<br>
Yeah, you ain't alone out there, look around you<br>
We got a lot of fans in here<br>
Couple hundred thousand, that's what we did last year<br>
Listen to Intro 3, trying to kill my fear<br>
They'll get that in a minute<br>
We about to shatter the critics<br>
I am a savage, admit it<br>
A lot of baggage I live in<br>
That's why the passion is different<br>
Really don't care if they get it<br>
We're only three records in it and this is just the beginning<br>
I'm home!<br></p></li>
