	<p>I'm lookin' like I'm gonna get it, you probably don't get it<br>
I come in your house with a microphone<br>
Lookin' like I'm about to set up a show in your kitchen<br>
I'm outta my mind but I feel like I'm in it<br>
If I never make it, don't make any difference<br>
I'm still gonna kill it<br>
You know what the deal is<br>
Ain't never no chillin' when I'm in the buildin'<br>
NF is a monster, I am a villain<br>
My music is sick, and you don't know what ill is<br>
You better get back, I don't write any filler<br>
I write what I feel and I'm feelin' a million<br>
So you better shh, be quiet, you hear it?<br>
I'm 'bout to lose it<br>
I'm on a whole different level of music<br>
Don't treat me like I don't have no clue how to do this<br>
You better rethink what you're thinkin' and move it<br>
Now picture me writin' when I was a kid tryna make it in music<br>
I'm thinkin' it's crazy<br>
I spent all my money on studio time, tryna get on my music so people could play it<br>
I'ma keep it one hundred, my music was terrible<br>
Learned to get better, the more that I made it<br>
Go back to my Moments album<br>
Most of you people, you probably don't know what I'm sayin', hold up!<br>
What you're witnessin' now, don't try to figure me out<br>
I grab on that microphone, jawin' the crowd<br>
They was laughin' at me, who they laughin' at now, huh?<br>
I laugh at myself, some people they lookin' like, wow<br>
The moment you told me that you was a rapper, I couldn't believe it<br>
You believe it now?<br>
Step in the booth and I murder it<br>
You never heard of a rapper that kill it like I do<br>
I sleep on the couch in the studio, stay up 'til 3 in the morning<br>
And write 'till I get more<br>
The moment I wake up I feel like I don't even sleep<br>
And I'm ready to put out my record<br>
Well, thank you for buyin' it!<br>
Maybe you burned it!<br>
But either way, I'm gonna wreck it!<br>
I look at the industry, look what it did to me<br>
You'll never make it if you never grind<br>
You put a whole lot of money into it, you better be ready to give it your time<br>
I look at the past few years of my life and I promise you I have been given it mine<br>
Try to keep up with this<br>
I'm not a puppet, no string on my back, I'm one of a kind<br>
Music is changing, no way to tame this<br>
I am an artist, look what I painted<br>
Hang up the caution tape, I'm dangerous<br>
Does anyone know where my brain is?<br>
Rappers are comfortable knowing they're famous<br>
But I really don't care what your name is<br>
And I really don't care if I'm nameless<br>
Y'all just drivin' around, I know where my lane is<br>
Cocky?<br>
Nah, I'm competitive?<br>
This is a job for me, it's adrenaline<br>
Don't try to box me in, I am Mayweather<br>
I come in the ring, my punches are way better<br>
I never drink but I live in these bars<br>
The moment you blink is the moment you lost<br>
Say you a king, who put you in charge?<br>
Don't care what you think, I'll break in your car<br>
Climb on the top of it, sound the alarm<br>
And wake up the neighborhood, rap in your yard<br>
And the carry the speakers on both of my arms<br>
'Til you keep sleepin' on me, I'm at large<br>
Enough with the jokes, I ain't jokin'<br>
You come in a session with me Imma show you what dope is<br>
And when I say dope I ain't talkin' 'bout smoke<br>
And I'm talkin' 'bout music that has an emotion<br>
I look at this mic, it's part of my family<br>
Take it away, I'm comin' to find you<br>
I've been through a lot in my life<br>
And it's hard to get people to listen when no one's behind you<br>
And then Capitol came in the picture and gave me a shot<br>
And look at it now<br>
I look at the team I'm dealin' with, these people ain't playin' around<br>
Lookin' back, I gotta laugh<br>
I was in a whole different place a year ago<br>
I look at the math, I look at the map<br>
And thank you God, I swear it's a miracle<br>
And I'm sorry, but I gotta leave<br>
But man, this track was beautiful<br>
The least I can do if I murder a beat is take the time to go his funeral<br></p></li>

	
	
	<li><span class="text1m">Mansion</span>
	
	
<p>Insidious is blind inception<br>
What's reality with all these questions?<br>
Feels like I missed my alarm and slept in<br>
Slept in<br>
Broken legs, but I chase perfection<br>
These walls are my blank expression<br>
My mind is a home I'm trapped in<br>
And it's lonely inside this mansion<br>


Yo, my mind is a house with walls, covered in lyrics<br>
They're all over the place, there's songs in the mirrors<br>
Written all over the floors, all over the chairs<br>
And you get the uncut version of life when I go downstairs<br>
That's where I write when I'm in a bad place and need to release<br>
And let out the version of NF you don't wanna see<br>
I put holes in the walls with both of my fists till they bleed<br>
You might get a glimpse of how I cope with all this anger in me<br>
Physically abused, now that's the room that I don't wanna be in<br>
That picture ain't blurry at all, I just don't wanna see it<br>
And these walls ain't blank, I just think I don't wanna see 'em<br>
But why not? I'm in here, so I might as well read 'em<br>
I gotta thank you for this anger that I carry around<br>
Wish I could take a match and burn this whole room to the ground<br>
Matter of fact, I think I'ma burn this room right now<br>
Somehow, this memory, for some reason, just won't burn down<br>
You used to put me in the corner, so you could see the fear in my eyes<br>
Then took me downstairs and beat me till I screamed and I cried<br>
Congratulations, you'll always have a room in my mind<br>
But I'ma keep the door shut and lock the lyrics inside<br>


Insidious is blind inception<br>

My mind is a home I'm trapped in<br>
And it's lonely inside this mansion, inside this mansion<br>


Yo, my mind is a house with walls, covered in pain<br>
See, my problem is, I don't fix things, I just try to repaint<br>
Cover 'em up, like it never happened, say, "I wish I could change"<br>
Are you confused? Come upstairs and I'll show you what I mean<br>
This room's full of regrets, it just keeps getting fuller, it seems<br>
The moment I walk into it's the same moment that I wanna leave<br>
I get sick to my stomach every time I look at these things<br>
But it's hard to look past when this is the room where I sleep<br>
I look around, one of the worst things I wrote on these walls<br>
Was the moment I realized that I was losing my mom<br>
One of the first things I wrote was, "I wish I woulda called"<br>
But I should just stop now, we ain't got enough room in this song<br>
And I regret the fact that I struggled trying to find who I am<br>
And I lie to myself and say I do the best that I can<br>
Shrug it off like it ain't nothing, like it's out of my hands<br>
Then get ticked off whenever I see it affecting my plans<br>
And I regret watchin' these trust issues eat me alive<br>
And at the rate I'm goin', they'll probably still be there when I die<br>
Congratulations, you'll always have a room in my mind<br>
The question is, will I ever clean the walls off in time?<br>


Insidious is blind inception<br>

And slept in<br>
Broken legs, but I chase perfection<br>

My mind is a home I'm trapped in<br>
And it's lonely inside this mansion, inside this mansion<br>


So this part of my house, no one's been in it for years<br>
I built a safe room and I don't let no one in there<br>
'Cause if I do, there's a chance that they might disappear<br>
And not come back, and I admit, I am emotionally scared<br>
To let anyone inside, so I just leave my doors locked<br>
You might get other doors to open up, but this door's not<br>
'Cause I don't want you to have the opportunity to hurt me<br>
And I'll be the only person that I can blame when you desert me<br>
I'm barricaded inside, so stop watchin'<br>
I'm not coming to the door, so stop knockin', stop knockin'<br>
I'm trapped here, God keeps saying I'm not locked in<br>
I chose this, I am lost in my own conscience<br>
I know that shuttin' the world out ain't solvin' the problem<br>
But I didn't build this house because I thought it would solve 'em<br>
I built it because I thought that it was safer in there<br>
But it's not, I'm not the only thing that's livin' in here<br>
Fear came to my house years ago, I let him in<br>
Maybe that's the problem, 'cause I've been dealing with this ever since<br>
I thought that he would leave, but it's obvious, he never did<br>
He must have picked a room and got comfortable and settled in<br>
Now I'm in a position, it's either sit here and let 'em win<br>
Or put him back outside where he came from, but I never can<br>
'Cause in order to do that, I'd have to open the doors<br>
Is that me or the fear talking? I don't know anymore<br>


It's lonely<br>
Inside (inside), inside (inside)<br>
It's lonely (it's lonely)<br>
Oh, yeah, it's loney<br>
Inside this mansion<br></p></li>
	
	
	<li><span class="text1m">All I Have</span>
	
	<p>All I ever wanted was somebody to hear me<br>
And all I ever wanted was somebody to feel me<br>
And everybody wanna tell me that I'm out of my head<br>
When I'm on the mic that's fine but that don't scare me<br>
It's been a long time but I'm back now<br>
Rap pow welcome to the rap house<br>
Rap pow will live till I pass out blackout blackout<br>
Everybody keep on wondering if I still rap now<br>
Are you serious, anybody out there hearing this?<br>
Yo I came in the game as a lyricist<br>
And I'ma leave like that, period<br>
You sniff lines, I write lines, you've now entered in my mind<br>
And you better get ready cause you might find<br>
I'm from a different place and my kind<br>
It's a little bit different than yours is<br>
Quit snoring hip hop isn't dead<br>
It's just been in mourning from the moment I quit recording<br>
Quick, record this<br>
Listen I'm warming up and you're misinformed if<br>
You think that I'm slipping up, this ain't sick enough, then I'll skip the chorus<br>
I've been here ain't nobody heard of me?<br>
Yeah I'ma turn this beat to a murder scene<br>
I don't live for the world<br>
I live for the King, I live for the King, focus<br>
Wrote this with emotion<br>
It's hard to get a break when the door's ain't open<br>
It's hard to get a shot when the gun ain't loaded<br>
And it's hard to make a living when nobody wanna notice. Hold it<br>
What am I insane maybe, plain crazy<br>
You put me in a room with a mic you will not restrain me<br>
You do what you wanted but you can't contain me<br>
Lazy is not a character trait of mine, don't wait in line<br>
This is the current condition of my state of mind<br>
Don't tell me that this isn't real<br>
Don't tell me this ain't how I feel<br>
This is all I have all I have<br>
All I ever wanted was somebody to get this<br>
All I ever wanted was somebody to play this<br>
Take my song, put it on their playlist and get goosebumps every time they play it, rate us<br>
If that's my calling or not Father, maybe I should just not bother<br>
Go back to that nine to five but I am not a quitter so quit that<br>
I never been a killer but I guarantee I kill tracks<br>
Put them in a coffin, lost in, rip that<br>
Trying to make an impact in rap, is that insane?<br>
Well, I guess so<br>
Rap though, better give me that pencil<br>
And you ain't ever gonna make it, it's all mental<br>
I am in a place where I can't let go ah!<br>
I still work a job and do this<br>
And y'all know what's stupid?<br>
I thought all you had to do was get a record deal and yo things start moving<br>
But that's not the case because most of the times the artists you hear<br>
You keep on thinking that artist is new but that artist has probably been at it for years<br>
Yeah, in the back of my mind thinking<br>
Am I wasting my time dreaming<br>
And I ain't got no money in my wallet but<br>
I guarantee there ain't no way that I am gonna leave this<br>
I need this I swear to y'all I need this<br>
And this hip-hop's in my veins if you cut me I'ma bleed it<br>
And yo. What you think I write write raps for no reason, no<br>
Take my pain and I put em in a song ever since them pills they took my mom<br>
I've been a different person, don't try to predict my verses<br>
What you're hearing now is me whether I'm in front or behind that curtain<br>
I stand behind these words I'm a Christian but I'm not perfect<br>
Don't tell me to calm down I'm calm now, listen I'm just working<br>
Yeah it might take a minute to get it but once you get it everything will be crystal clear<br>
I don't think they see my vision here I don't think they see my vision here!<br>
Don't tell me that this isn't real<br>
Don't tell me this ain't how I feel<br>
This is all I have. All I have<br>
Don't tell me that this isn't real<br>
Don't tell me this ain't how I feel<br>
This is all I have. All I have<br>
Don't tell me that this isn't real<br>
Don't tell me this ain't how I feel<br>
This is all I have. All I have<br>
All I have<br>
Don't tell me that this isn't real (this isn't real, this isn't real)<br>
This is all that I have, this is all that I have<br></p></li>

Guess you don't want me, you don't want me<br>
(Wait)<br>
We back and forth, yeah, this ain't working, this ain't working<br>
Love ain't perfect, love ain't perfect<br>


I'm holding on to pieces of us<br>
That I just can't let go<br>
I know this is a desperate kind of love<br>
But it feels like it's home<br>
Where you going? (Where you going?)<br>
I'm holding on to pieces of us<br>

Where you going? (Where you going?)<br>
I'm holding on to pieces of us<br>
Cause I just can't let go
<br>

We don't wanna have a conversation<br>
We dont wanna think about it, we wanna just fake it<br>
We just wanna act like everything is great<br>
Go back to the day watchin' movies in the basement<br>
And the problem is now I'm feeling like everything is changed<br>
And I'm trying to make a livin' on the music<br>
But I feel like every time I look at you I'm in a place<br>
It's hard to be the man of the house when you ain't gotta house (I hate this)<br>
It's complicated, it's complicated<br>
We don't wanna talk (we don't wanna talk)<br>
It's complicated<br>
I'm sitting in the hotel room like, "Why?"<br>
I call your phone and apologize<br>
There's gotta be a way we can make this right<br>
We can make this right<br>


I'm holding on to pieces of us<br>
That I just can't let go<br>
I know this is a desperate kind of love<br>
But it feels like it's home<br>
Where you going? (Where you going?)<br>

	<li><span class="text1m">Wake Up</span>
	
<p>	You spend your life in a dream that you can't escape<br>
'Cause you live your life in a coma, you're never awake<br>
If you'd open your eyes then maybe you'd see what's at stake<br>
You're sleeping, you're sleeping<br>
You make a lot of money and you live in a mansion<br>
And pretty much got everything that you could ever imagine<br>
But you feel like even though you got everything in the world<br>
You got nothing, so what you do then is you start going backwards<br>
You runnin' in a direction<br>
And you lookin' for something that isn't real<br>
And all you know is that you just gotta have it<br>
What you're doin' is sleepin'<br>
And thinking that you're awake and you're not<br>
And the problem is that you don't know what you're after<br>
So you put everything that you have into what you do<br>
Hoping that one day maybe you don't have to feel like you're empty<br>
But as you get older a lot of weight on your shoulders is getting heavy<br>
Then you look back and you start to regret things<br>
You only get one life<br>
And every time you lookin' at yours<br>
You feel like everything you have is a waste!<br>
And the problem and the reason you could never fill a hole in your life<br>
Is because you were never awake<br>
You spend your life in a dream that you can't escape<br>
'Cause you live your life in a coma, you're never awake<br>
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up<br>
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up<br>
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up<br>
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up<br>
You wake up in the morning<br>
But you feel like you never got up and go to work<br>
And you feelin' like you ain't got a purpose<br>
And you tryna get motivated but everything you do turns into a mess<br>
Like you ain't nothing but worthless<br>
And, yo, you look around<br>
A lot of these other people you lookin' at<br>
To you, you describe as perfect<br>
So you point a finger at God and tell him to do his job<br>
And fix ya' life up cause nothin' is workin'<br>
And you will try to hide and make it seem like it's nothin'<br>
But really you feel like everything is crashin' around you<br>
And you develop a problem in trustin' in other people<br>
Which later became an issue that will mentally pound you<br>
You only get one life<br>
But every time you lookin' at yours you feel like all you ever see are mistakes<br>
And the problem and the reason you could never move forward in life<br>
Is because you were never awake<br>
Wake up<br>
You spend your life in a dream that you can't escape<br>
'Cause you live your life in a coma, you're never awake<br>
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up<br>
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up<br>
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up<br>
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up<br>
You spend your life in a dream that you can't escape<br>
'Cause you live your life in a coma, you're never awake<br>
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up<br></p></li>

	
		<li><span class="text1m">Face It</span>
	
<p>	Yeah, I ain't sleeping lately<br>
I ain't sleeping lately<br>
Yes I know that I'm the only person that can change me<br>
Maybe, that's why I ain't changing<br>
That's why I ain't changing<br>
I got too much on my mind I guess I don't know how to face it<br>
I just don't know how to face it<br>
I don't know how to face it, yeah<br>

I don't know how to face it<br>   
Don't know how to face it<br>   
I don't know how to face it<br>   
I don't know how to face it, how to face it ah<br>   
Don't know how to face it<br>   
Let's go back to basics<br>   
Yes say what you mean, do what you say, but man I hate this<br>   
I just don't know what I'm chasing, don't know what I'm chasing<br>   
Yes, somebody told me<br>   
Life is something you don't wanna play with<br>   
But I just keep on playing like life is just a playground<br>   
I go through these mood swings<br>   
Watch everything slide down<br>   
I look at myself and I ask what the goal is<br>   
Yeah tell me what your goal is<br>   
I'm just so lost in emotions, I don't even notice<br>   
I just slip into a place and I don't think straight<br>   
Devil in my ear trynna tell me everything's great<br>   
And in a year I realize I'm in the same place<br>   
Running in the same race same pace<br>   
Yeah, I ain't sleeping lately<br>   
I ain't sleeping lately<br>   
Yes I know that I'm the only person that can change me<br>   
Maybe, that's why I ain't changing<br>   
That's why I ain't changing<br>   
I got too much on my mind I guess I don't know how to face it<br>   
I just don't know how to face it<br>   
I don't know how to face it, yeah<br>   
Don't know how to face it<br>   
I don't know how to face it<br>   
Don't know how to face it<br>   
I don't know how to face it<br>   
I don't know how to face it, how to face it ah<br>   
Don't know how to face it<br>   
Let's go back to basics<br>   
Think about the words you 'bout to say before you say it<br>   
Sin is bittersweet I taste it, bittersweet I taste it<br>   
Get that sickness out my mouth<br>   
I feel like my train is derailing<br>   
I can feel it<br>   
Yo these words are only words until they actions<br>   
Words until they actions strive on empty satisfactions<br>   
Yeah the fact is I don't know, fact is I don't know<br>   
Yeah I get on these stages say that I put on a show<br>   
But yeah that show it don't mean nothing<br>   
If I don't live my lyrics, if they don't feel the spirit in my songs<br>   
Then they don't hear it<br>   
Homie yeah that don't mean nothing<br>   
This ain't all about appearance<br>   
Everything starts with the man in the mirror<br>   
I ain't sleeping lately<br>   
I ain't sleeping lately<br>   
Yes I know that I'm the only person that can change me<br>   
Maybe, that's why I ain't changing<br>   
That's why I ain't changing<br>   
I got too much on my mind I guess I don't know how to face it<br>   
I just don't know how to face it<br>   
I don't know how to face it, yeah<br>   
I don't know how to face it<br>   
I don't know how to face it<br>   
I don't know how to face it, how to face it aaah<br>   </p></li>

	
	<li><span class="text1m">Motivated</span>
	
<p>	I've been, I've been doing this a long time<br>   
I mean over half my life<br>   
It's awesome for me to be able to put out music that people will actually hear<br>   
Especially when you put this much time into something that you love<br>   
something that you have a passion for<br>   
That's motivation<br>   
Ah, I'm motivated (motivated)<br>   
Motivated (motivated)<br>   
Motivated (motivated)<br>   
Motivated, ah<br>   
Ah, I'm motivated (motivated)<br>   
Motivated (motivated)<br>   
Motivated (motivated)<br>   
Motivated, ah<br>   
When I first started, never knew if they will listen<br>   
But when I write, I produce passion, that's Mel Gibson<br>   
If music is a disease, I promise I'm infected<br>   
I dream on different levels of dreams, Inception<br>   
And these beats are my playground, let the words play<br>   
You ain't catch it? <br>   
That's wordplay<br>   
Now you're stuck on the word "play"<br>   
I'm all business, no suit on, but that's okay<br>   
I will K.O. you, if you come in my work space<br>   
And don't you ever try to tell me I lack passion<br>   
I'm a stand up guy, I promise you ain't laughing<br>   
These rappers are slowing the game down, bad traffic<br>   
And how you gonna put me in a category of wack rappin'?<br>   
Listen, I'm Hulk, I transform and I smash rappers<br>   
You sipping on syrup, that doesn't mean you a sick rapper<br>   
See what it means is you gon' probably get sick after<br>   
You don't like that I'm blunt, or is it the fact that I smoke passion?<br>   
Take your best shot<br>   
Take your best shot<br>   
Take your best shot<br>   
I ain't going nowhere, nowhere<br>   
Ah, I'm motivated (motivated)<br>   
Motivated (motivated)<br>   
Motivated (motivated)<br>   
Motivated, ah<br>   
Ah, I'm motivated (motivated)<br>   
Motivated (motivated)<br>   
Motivated (motivated)<br>   
Motivated, ah<br>   
I put work in this music, you think I'm making this up?<br>   
If the songs ain't sharp, trust me they ain't making the cut<br>   
You don't like it? <br>   
I'm no teacher, but you'll learn to adjust<br>   
I'm my own worst critic, so critics step your hate game up<br>   
I'm a different breed of artist, I know how to survive<br>   
You come into my lane, you better know how to drive<br>   
And I suggest you buckle up if you gon' come on this ride<br>   
No Johnny Cash but some of y'all are walking the line<br>   
But you wrong though, y'all look curious<br>   
Heath Ledger type of questions like, "why so serious?"<br>   
And you want watered down lyrics? <br>   
Well I don't carry 'em<br>   
I dig holes for these tracks, and then I slaughter and bury 'em<br>   
The motivation I got is on a whole different level<br>   
I treat these lines like court case, I don't wanna settle<br>   
My lyrics are like bullets and they're aiming at you<br>   
And I ain't talking Switchfoot when I dare you to move<br>   
Take your best shot<br>   
Take your best shot<br>   
Take your best shot<br>   
I ain't going nowhere, nowhere<br>   
Ah, I'm motivated (motivated)<br>   
Motivated (motivated)<br>   
Motivated (motivated)<br>   
Motivated, ah<br>   
Ah, I'm motivated (motivated)<br>   
Motivated (motivated)<br>   
Motivated (motivated)<br>   
Motivated, ah<br>   
And when it comes to punches, you know I'mma land mine<br>   
No I said I'm a land mine<br>   
Don't step on me, or you get blown sky high<br>   
And I don't mean secrets when I say to keep it in mind<br>   
That I'm ill with the words, too sick<br>   
They say I rap hungry, well that's 'cause I'm star-vin (Vin), Diesel<br>   
That´s why they calling me riddick-ulous (ridiculous)<br>   
'Cause the look in my eyes is different<br>   
Y'all ain't ready, rewind that back<br>   
Y'all ain't ready, rewind that back<br>   
Y'all ain't ready<br>   
Lets go<br>   
Take your best shot<br>   
Take your best shot<br>   
Take your best shot<br>   
I ain't going nowhere, nowhere<br>   
Ah, I'm motivated (motivated)<br>

	<p>You and I we've been through a lot together<br>   
And I look back and I just uh, I appreciate all the times that we had together, you know?<br>   
I remember just going down in my room and<br>   
You know down, and trying to deal with some things<br>   
And you have always been there for that<br>   
Always, just me and you<br>   
You and I've been best friends, ever since I was a young kid<br>   
Everything we did, where has time went?<br>   
Got a lot of years coming up ahead of us<br>   
And ever since we met<br>   
I knew we'd get somewhere<br>   
But the fact is I ain't really, I ain't really know when<br>   
I ain't really know how we'd do, but I can feel the goose bumps my skin writing<br>   
Now I've been waiting for the moment<br>   
You and I can make it happen<br>   
Lot of people think we ain't gonna make it rapping<br>   
I ain't got a problem with em though, they don't even matter<br>   
We ain't looking for the people tryna say that we the baddest<br>   
No I never liked that, came a long way, never did it for the money<br>   
We ever make it big, I'ma give it to the family, looking back now everything is looking funny<br>   
You and I in the room writing, up late when the mood strikes us<br>   
We don't care if they do like us<br>   
Writing songs for the haters we ain't even got yet<br>   
Freestyling somebody turn the mic up<br>   
Talking bout things we don't really understand<br>   
Talking bout things we don't really comprehend<br>   
Me and you tryna get it, we ain't quitting till the end<br>   
Now I'm standing on stage tryna give it to the fans, yah<br>   
We took that karaoke machine from my room<br>   
And ah, we put it up to my CD player and played instrumentals<br>   
Man we've come a long way<br>   
A long way<br>   
I made a lot of mistakes<br>   
You've been there for the whole thing<br>   
Help me with the drama<br>   
Rapping in the car outside daily<br>   
We don’t care if it’s the winter<br>   
We don’t care if its the summer<br>   
I remember writing raps with the curse words<br>   
I just wanna hear it<br>   
It seems like everybody does it<br>   
Did it for awhile wasn't into all the cussin'<br>   
Trying to find who I was<br>   
Being everything I wasn't<br>   
Real life yeah<br>   
Gotta lot of anger<br>   
You know where I'm at<br>   
Put it all of it in the pages<br>   
And wrote it into raps, said that we could be amazing, if I give us a chance<br>   
Now im lookin round like yeah, look at where we at?<br>   
Look at where we at now, we ain't made it yet but they can here us in the background comin'<br>   
Some are gonna hate it, some are gonna love it<br>   
I'ma put it in his hands and let God do the judging, yah!<br>   
Remember me and you always had you in the backpack<br>   
Took you into school writing on you like its nuthin' a lot of people in the room<br>   
See me scribble on a page but they ain't got a clue, naw they ain't got a clue<br>   
We're here to begin it hoping someday you and I can say<br>   
We made it and we did it<br>   
You ain't nuthin but a notepad to me, Who am I kiddin?<br>   
I'm just runnin out of space I'll be back in a minute<br>   
Turn the page homie<br>   
You know what’s crazy is<br>   
This just started as something that was an escape for us<br>   
You know<br>   
And now I look around and, there’s a lot of people going<br>   
Through the same things that we've been through<br>   
Now this music we write is actually making an impact it’s crazy<br>   
NF real music<br>   </p></li>

	<p>Red Bull in my hands, feels like I got wings<br>   
Lotta people in my face, but I can't hear a thing<br>   
It's like my heads up in the clouds, heads up in the clouds<br>   
And I ain't coming down, no<br>   
Just turn the music on, just let me get lost<br>   
I swear that Imma lose it if somebody turns it off<br>

Fast, better keep pedalin'<br>   
Blast you with the pen again<br>   
Laugh, but I’m ahead of them<br>   
Act, like I don’t get it then<br>   
That is when I enter in<br>   
Rap until I never can<br>   
Cash, it is irrelevant<br>   
Passion is the element<br>   
Laps around these other men<br>   
Pass 'em, who you runnin’ with<br>   
Facts, is what I’m coming with<br>   
Back, but I ain’t never left<br>   
Swift, but I will never get<br>   
Wack, you better get a grip<br>   
Last isn’t a medal it’s glass and I'ma shatter it<br>   
Who do you think you battling?<br>   
Who do you think you laughing at?<br>   
I am not a comedian, man it don’t even matter<br>   
If you don’t know what I’m saying, you better do what the chorus says<br>

<p>When did I become so numb?<br>   
When did I lose myself?<br>   
All the words that leave my tongue<br>   
Feel like they came from someone else<br>   
I'm paralyzed<br>   
Where are my feelings?<br>   
I no longer feel things<br>   
I know I should<br>   
I'm paralyzed<br>   
Where is the real me?<br>   
I’m lost and it kills me inside<br>   
I'm paralyzed<br>   
When did I become so cold?<br>   
When did I become ashamed? (oh)<br>   
Where's the person that I know?<br>   
They must have left<br>   
They must have left<br>   
With all my faith<br>   
I'm paralyzed<br>   
Where are my feelings?<br>   
I no longer feel things<br>   
I know I should<br>   
I'm paralyzed<br>   
Where is the real me?<br>   
I’m lost and it kills me inside<br>   
I'm paralyzed<br>   
I'm paralyzed<br>   
I'm scared to live but I'm scared to die<br>   
And if life is pain then I buried mine a long time ago<br>   
But it's still alive<br>   
And it's taking over me where am I?<br>   
I wanna feel something, I'm numb inside<br>   
But I feel nothing, I wonder why<br>   
And on the race of life time passes by<br>   
Look<br>   
I sit back and I watch it, hands in my pockets<br>   
Waves come crashing over me but I just watch 'em<br>   
I just watch 'em<br>   
I'm under water but I feel like I'm on top of it<br>   
I'm at the bottom and I don’t know what the problem is<br>   
I'm in a box<br>   
But I’m the one who locked me in<br>   
Suffocating and I'm running out of oxygen<br>   
I'm paralyzed<br>   
Where are my feelings?<br>   
I no longer feel things<br>   
I know I should<br>   
I'm paralyzed<br>   
Where is the real me?<br>   
I’m lost and it kills me inside<br>   
I'm paralyzed (I'm just so paralyzed)<br>   
Where are my feelings? (yeah, I'm just so paralyzed)<br>   
I no longer feel things (I have no feelings)<br>   
I know I should (oh how come I’m not moving why aren’t I moving ay yeah)<br>   
I'm paralyzed<br>   
Where is the real me? (where is the real me, where is the real me?)<br>   
I'm lost and it kills me inside (I'm paralyzed, I'm paralyzed)<br>

Oh this heart is tired<br>   
Oh this soul is tired<br>   
But I'll keep on<br>   
I'll keep on<br>   
I'll keep on<br>   
I'll keep on<br>   
I'll keep on<br>   
I'll keep on<br>   
Faith is something I am not accustomed to<br>   
Trusting other people's something I don't really love to do<br>   
I've never been a fan of it, I act tougher<br>   
Really my shoulders they ain't built for this and I don't have nothing<br>   
It's like I'm standing in the rain and you offer me a raincoat<br>   
But I would rather stand there being wet than take the handout<br>   
What's wrong with me?<br>   
You said, you've always got your hands out<br>   
And I can't continue on my own so take my hands now<br>   
I give you everything, God, not just a little bit<br>   
Take it from me, I am nothing but a hypocrite<br>   
I hate sin but I built a house and asked to live in it<br>   
Afraid to open up the door to you, let you into it<br>   
My soul is lost and what it needs is your direction<br>   
I know, I've told you I do not need your protection<br>   
But I lied to you, this thing is tiring<br>   
A man was not created for a God<br>   
Please retire me now<br>   
Oh these hands are tired<br>   
Oh this heart is tired<br>   
Oh this soul is tired<br>   
But I'll keep on<br>   
I'll keep on<br>   
I'll keep on<br>   
I'll keep on<br>   
I'll keep on<br>   
I'll keep on<br>   
Trust is something I am not accustomed to<br>   
And I know the Bible says that I should always trust in you<br>   
But, I will never read that book enough<br>   
And when I have a question I don't take the time to look it up<br>   
Or pick it up<br>   
It collects dust on my nightstand<br>   
I'm just being honest<br>   
Please take this outta my hands<br>   
I have no control, I am just a person<br>   
But thank the Lord that I serve a God that's perfect<br>   
I do not deserve the opportunity you've given me<br>   
I never knew what freedom was until I learned what prison means<br>   
I am not ashamed, I don't care if they remember me<br>   
My life will always have a hold of you and not the centerpiece<br>   
Take me out of bondage, take all of my pride<br>   
If I don't have a Savior, I don't have nothing inside<br>   
Take all of my lust, take all of my lies<br>   
There's no better feeling then when I look in the sky, in your eyes, it's amazing<br>   
Oh these hands are tired<br>   
Oh this heart is tired<br>   
Oh this soul is tired<br>   
But I'll keep on<br>   
I'll keep on<br>   
I'll keep on<br>   
I'll keep on<br>   
I'll keep on<br>

I ain't got you<br>   
If I ain't got you<br>   
I'm lonely<br>   
If I ain't with you I'm lonely<br>   
I'm lonely<br>   
I need you<br>   
I need you<br>   
Can you hold me? <br>   
Can you hold me in your arms?<br>   
Feel like it's just me, like it's just me<br>   
What it gon' take? <br>   
What it gon' be?<br>   
I don't even know, I don't even know<br>   
But I'm lonely, lonely<br>   
Feel like I don't even know me<br>   
Feels like I don't even know me<br>   
I don't even know me</p></li>
