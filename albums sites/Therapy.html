	<pre>I'm back, did anyone miss me?
They said a second record could be tricky
Well that's kind of funny 'cause I am not tripping
My fans, they know what it is and they with me
Yeah, I ain't the type that's gon' ride with the semi
I came from a town with three lakes and no city
I've been doing shows for nothing but pennies
When I leave the stage, they never forget me
Mansion was a glimpse of my life
I let you see what it's like to be in my head
People ask me what I think I think I be doin'
If it wasn't music, I'd rather be dead
You heard what I said, that was like me at a 3, you don't want to see me at 10
Or maybe you do
I promise if that is the case, then that is what you're gonna get
If you're looking for music with watered down lyrics
I promise that you need to go somewhere else
And if you want somebody to tell you everything that you wanna<br> hear I won't be any help
This flow is familiar, I think I heard it before
Oh yeah, I made it myself
I left the door open to come in my mansion but I never said it's a beautiful house
Some of ya'll sat on the porch
Looked at my windows and stared at my door
They ask me if I'm going to kill it this record
I laugh in their face and I ask 'em, "Do you see the blood on the floor?"
He's at it again, NF is crazy he's bad with the kids
He never talks about nothing but him
Yeah, my friends say, "He's kind of a diva"
Well, you need to get some new friends
I'm as true as it gets
'Til I get on the stage and flip on the switch
And I go to a place where nobody is
If you putting my name in the song, that's something that you won't regret
I'm not lying to you here
I remember the shows when no one was there
I remember the shows when nobody cared
Some people in front of me laughing like, "He isn't going nowhere"
It's funny now, isn't it?
This type of life isn't how I envisioned it
This type of life, it just ain't how I pictured it
I'm in the back of the tour bus, trying to face how my family is different
Not what you think it is
Write a review, tell me what you think of this
Give me three stars and call me and idiot
But to be honest, it don't make a difference
I know some people don't get it
But you have now entered the Therapy Session
If you don't like music that's personal
I have no clue what you people are doing here
Might as well throw out the record
I pull up a chair
I track through my music like nobody's there
Only person I judge is the one in the mirror
I'm lately he ain't doin' well
I don't need ya'll in my ear
I'm tired of hearing it
You call it music, I call it my therapist
Sick people telling me I have been carrying way too much baggage
I need to take care of it
I know she's right, but man it's embarrassing
Music has raised me more than my parents did
Take out a picture of us and I stare at it
Who am I kidding? You probably ain't hearing this
Show me an artist you want to compare me with
You put us both on a track, I'm a bury 'em
Give me this shovel, it's 'bout to get scarier
None of you want to attack what you staring at
I see you got beats, but where is the lyrics at?
NF is the logo, you know I been wearing that
Don't come to my show and be sittin' in the very back
I call you out in the crowd like, "There he is!"
I thought I'd be happy, It feels like I'm cursed
It's hard to be clean when you play in the dirt
You gave me this place to go when I'm hurting
I thought it'd get better, but it's getting worse
And I got nobody to blame when I work, like 24/7
I ain't been to church, and Satan keep callin' me, he tryin' to flirt
I hang up the phone, these are more than just words
I drive on that highway and listen to Mansion
I look up to God like, "When did this happen?"
Yelling with all of my fans to "Wake up!"
But feel like I haven't
I get emotional, I didn't plan this
I'm doing things I never imagined
I'm sorry but I gotta leave
I don't wanna be late for my therapy session</pre>
</li>
	
	<li><span class="text1t">Therapy Session</span>
	
	<pre>Yeah, I gotta say like a month ago
I was talking to fans
And one of them pulled me aside and said
"We never met but I swear that you know who I am
I been through a lot
I don't know how to express it to people
Don't think that I can but I got that mansion CD on rotation
That's real for me Nate, you do not understand"
It's crazy for me
Kids hit me up, say they slitting they wrists on the daily
This music is more than you think
Don't book me for just entertainment, it's entertaining
Hearing these parents, they telling their kids
My music is violent, you gotta be kidding me
I guess that your definition of violence and mine
Is something that we look at differently
How do you picture me ah?
Want me to smile, you want me to laugh
You want me to walk in the stage with a smile on my face
When I'm mad and put on a mask, for real though
I mean, what you expect from me?
I'm tryna do this respectfully
They say that life is a race
I know my problems'll probably catch up eventually
I do my best to be calm
How you gon' write me and tell me you slaughter my family?
That's just a glimpse to the stuff that get sent to me
These the parts of my life that'll never see, woo
I am aware it's aggressive
I am not here for acceptance
I don't know what you expect here
But what you expect when you walk in a therapy session?
Therapy, therapy session
Therapy, therapy session
This girl at the show looked me in the face
And told me her life's full of drama
Said that her dad is abusive
Apparently he likes to beat on her mama
I got so angry inside
I wanted to tell her to give me his number
But what you gon' do with it right?
You gon' hit him up then he'll start hitting her harder
That's real
These kids, they come to my shows
With tears in they eyes
Imagine someone looking at you
And saying your music's the reason that they are alive
Sometimes, I don't know how to handle it
This type of life isn't glamorous
This ain't an act for the cameras
You see me walk on these stages but have no idea what I'm dealing with after it
I put it all in the open
This is the way that I cope with all my emotion
I'm taking pictures with thousands of people
But honestly, I feel like nobody knows me
I'm trying to deal with depression
I'm trying to deal with the pressure
How you gon' tell me my music does not have a message
When I'm looking out at this crowd full of people I know I affected?
Ah, I got some things in my life, I know I should let 'em go
Let me jot it down, let me take a mental note
I put it all in this microphone, think about that for a minute
What is the point of this song, I'm just venting but <br>what you expect from a therapy session?
Therapy, therapy session
Therapy, therapy session
What you think about me
That doesn't worry me
I know I handle some things immaturely
I know that I need to grow in maturity
I ain't gon' walk on these stages in front of these people
And act like I live my life perfectly
That doesn't work for me
Christian is not the definition of a perfect me, woo
I ain't the type to be quiet
I ain't gon' sit here in silence
If I wouldn't say what I say to your face
Then I promise you I wouldn't say it in private
I am not lying
People go off on my page and I'm trying to quit the replying
But this is ridiculous
I'm passionate man, I really mean what I'm writing
You want me to keep it 100? Okay, I'll keep it 100
I see a whole lot of talking on socials
But honestly, I don't see nothing in public
I kinda love it, yeah
"Why don't you write us some happy raps?
That would be awesome
All your music is moody and dark, Nate"
Don't get me started
You wanna know what it's like if you met me in person?
Listen to my verses
This music is not just for people
Who sit in the pews and pray at the churches
I won't reject it
I don't expect everyone to respect it
I don't expect you to get my perspective
What you expect from a therapy session?
I mean, I think sometimes people they confuse what I'm doing
I write about life, I write about things that I'm actually dealing with
Something that I'm actually experiencing, this is real for me
Like this is something that personally helps me as well
I'm not confused about who gave me the gift
God gave me the gift and he gave me the ability to do this
And he also gave me this as an outlet
And that's what music is for me
When I feel something, whether it's anger
Um, it's a passion about something, or frustration
Like this is where I go, this is, that's the whole NFrealmusic thing man
This is real for me, I need this, this is a therapy for me</pre></li>
	
	<li><span class="text1t">I Just Wanna Know</span>
	
	<pre>Yeah, yeah, only time you ever call me is when you feelin’<br> like don't nobody else wanna listen
When’s the last time you saw me
You probably don’t remember that ’cause that was back then you were different
I don’t wanna hear the sorry’s
I’m tired of all the talkin’ to be honest I would rather see a difference
Yeah, you pass me in the hallway
But you ain’t say a word to me
Lately all I ever feel is distant
You don’t care that you lost me
What’s wrong with ya
Had a picture of you sittin’ on the dash in the car with me
Now it’s in my closet with the other ones sittin’ in a box
I don’t wanna open up
You took it all from me
You told me you would die for me
Yeah, all you ever do is lie to me
Wish that I could say that this has come as surprise to me
Tell me that I never took the time and now you ain’t got the time for me, yeah
I just wanna know oh, oh, oh, oh
When did you get so cold oh, oh, oh
What happened to your soul oh oh oh
Don’t you see me
Yeah, we used to talk like best friends
I remember that I guess I don’t know what happened to us
Now you got me questionin’ what trust is
You told me you would be there for me
Yeah, but you ain’t really mean it did ya
Now you wanna jump ship
Leave me here alone
Well, I’m used to it
Everybody else did
Who you havin’ fun with
Don’t tell me I don't wanna know every time I ask I just feel sick
You're the one that jumped in
Told me you had some feelins
Now you tryin’ to tell me that is not true
I ain’t gotta clue
Who I’m lookin’ at right now, but I know the person that I’m lookin’ at is not you
Yeah
They say that you are who you hang with
Maybe that’s the reason you been changin’
Maybe that’s the reason why I’m feelin’ like you’re dangerous
And every time we talk it’s like I’m talkin’ to a stranger
I just wanna know oh, oh, oh, oh
When did you get so cold oh, oh, oh
What happened to your soul oh oh oh
Don’t you see me
I thought that we were close 
But now that door is closed 
When did we lose control 
Guess you don’t need me
I just wanna know oh, oh, oh, oh
When did you get so cold
What happened to your soul 
Don’t you see me
I thought that we were close 
But now that door is closed
When did we lose control
Guess you don’t need me</pre></li>
	
	
	<li><span class="text1t">How Could You Leave Us</span>
	
<pre>How could you leave us so unexpected?
We were waiting, we were waiting
For you but you just left us
We needed you, I needed you
Yo, I don't know what it's like to be addicted to pills
But I do know what it's like to be a witness it kills
Mama told me she love me, I'm thinking this isn't real
I think of you when I get a whiff of that cigarette smell, yeah
Welcome to the bottom of hell
They say pain is a prison, let me out of my cell
You say you proud of me, but you don't know me that well
Sit in my room, tears running down my face and I yell
Into my pillowcases, you say you coming to get us
Then call 'em a minute later just to tell us you not, I'm humiliated
I'm in a room with a parent that I don't barely know
Some lady in the corner watching us, while she taking notes
I don't get it mom, don't you want to watch your babies grow?
I guess that pills are more important, all you have to say is no
But you won't do it will you? You gon' keep popping 'til those pills kill you
I know you gone but I can still feel you
Why would you leave us? Why would you leave us here?
How could you leave us here?
How would you leave us? Why would you leave us?
Oh, Hey
I got this picture in my room and it kills me
But I don't need a picture of my mom, I need the real thing
Now a relationship is something we won't ever have
Why do I feel like I lost something that I never had?
You shoulda been there when I graduated
Told me you love me and congratulations
Instead you left us at the window waiting
Where you at mom? We're too young to understand where you at huh?
Yeah, I know those drugs got you held captive
I can see it in your eyes, they got your mind captured
Some say it's fun to get the high but I am not laughing
What you don't realise and what you not grasping
That I was nothing but a kid who couldn't understand
I ain't gon' say that I forgive you cause it hasn't happened
I thought that maybe I feel better as time passes
If you really cared for me, then where you at then?
Why would you leave us? Why would you leave us?
How could you leave us here?
How would you leave us? Why would you leave us?
Hey
Our last conversation, you and I sat in the living room
Talking 'bout my music and I brought you something to listen to
You started crying, telling me this isn't you
Couple weeks later, guess you were singing a different tune
You took them pills for the last time, didn't you?
They took you from us once, guess they came back to finish you
Crying my eyes out in the studio is difficult
Music is the only place that I can go to speak to you
It took everything inside of me to not scream at your funeral
Sitting in my chair, that person talking was pitiful
I wish you were here mama but every time I picture you
All I feel is pain, I hate the way I remember you
They found you on the floor, I could tell that you felt hollow
Gave everything you had plus your life to them pill bottles
You gave everything you had plus your life to them pill bottles
Don't know if you hear me or not, but if you still watching why
Why would you leave us? Why would you leave us?
How could you leave us here?
How would you leave us? Why would you leave us?
Hey	</pre></li>
	
	<li><span class="text1t">Breathe</span>
	
<pre>Breathe
Breathe


I grew up in a small place, had to drive an hour just to see a movie
I'm a simple person, city life just doesn't move me
I'd rather be home with my grandparents and playing Euchre
Didn't wanna leave but this dream's calling, I had to do it
I left my girl there, wish I would've done it different
She was right when she told me that I don't ever listen
I told her I would change a million times and never did it
Apologies don't mean a thing if you don't ever fix it
I love what I do but it's not what I expected
This industry is not your friend, well that's my perspective
Sometimes the closest people to you make you feel protected
But those are the same people that hurt you most and leave you guessing
Some people say nobody's perfect but expect perfection
How you supposed to find the answer if you don't ask the question?
Sometimes I look into the mirror and talk to my reflection
When I go home and turn the music off, what am I left with?


Breathe
Breathe


We used to be close but as time passed, we became disconnected
You never felt love and I always felt disrespected
Your family thought I was a joke, I was always defensive
They just wanted what was best for you, I just couldn't accept it
And hurting you was not a part of my plan or my intentions
But I was immature, I guess I had to learn some lessons
We grew apart and our lives went in different directions
And there's a lot of responsibilities that I neglected
I had a lot that was bottled inside, couldn't express it
And this pain won't leave, I can feel the depression
It's taking over my body, feels like I'm always stressing
Doctor told me I should sleep, but I'm always restless
I lay awake at night and think, my thoughts are relentless
I need a moment to breathe, I need a moment to vent this
I seem to be the only person that I play pretend with
And when I turn the music off, what am I really left with huh?


Breathe
Breathe	</pre></li>
	
	
	<li><span class="text1t">Real</span>
	
<pre>	Yeah, real music
(Yeah)
Yo, ya just get in that, you get in that head space, ya know
Somebody get the body bags, working with beats and
Put the MC’s in 'em, season 'em, put 'em on a beat with me, then I’m eating 'em
Get away from the table, you rappers ain’t hungry enough,<br> you rappers ain't hungry like ah
They talk about me like I'm here, they talk about you like you was
That nurse came into my room, she told me I'm sick in the head
I'm in hip-hop's hospital bed with a pad and a pen and a brace on my neck
They told me that I’m never leaving, why? I am as ill as it gets
Any rapper that say that they runnin' the game
I'mma come in they session and cut off they legs, woo
Strap a grenade to my head, pull out the pin
My music is mind blowin', ain't nobody do it like I do it
You ain’t never been on my level, I gotta part 'em out the way
To keep 'em talking and acting like everybody 
Gonna get up in a sleep with your eyes open
You wanna know what I noticed?
I look around and my fanbase and they ready
That last album was heavy, that last album was gritty
How you gon' match that? Just let me
Do what I do best
You're better off playing Russian roulette
Then comin' in a booth with me cause I get
A little bit intense, I’m like, “Who’s next?”
Y'all better watch it, take a look at where the clock is
It’s my time, this ladder of music that I climbed
I took the machete, the game isn’t ready
Them rappers, they coming up on me, I cut off the ladder, and I told 'em, “bye-bye”
What? Were you lookin’ for a high-five? Nice try
Do not believe everything that you read on the Internet
I do not know who your dentist is, but he should clean out your mouth
Don’t call me a sellout, that’s something I’ve never been
I've been through hell all my life though
But I know where heaven is
Father forgive me, for I am a sinner
But you gave me music as medicine
And nobody want a problem when they get in my zone better leave me be
I'm a mean MC, better feed me rappers or feed me beats, ah, feed me both of 'em
They like "Nate, what's it like to be famous?"
Um, I'll let you know if I make it
I wonder what life will be like if I didn't stick out my neck
200 dollars inside of my bank account, woo, I was living on that
I need some money to pay for my rent, I need some money to pay for my gas
I'm not complaining, I'm just being honest, I promise that<br> I will not beg for respect, no
I get so frustrated, take a look at what I created
Time is wasting and I ain't waiting
I'm a doctor with no job
Me, I don't have no patients
I keep pacing back and forth, I keep racing
You ain't never been in my book and I got a problem with it, why? 
'Cause you acting like you read my pages
I wreck these stages, real talk, better give me space 'cause I am chasing
Something they told me that I won't make it, I'm not famous, I'm just Nathan
And I wonder how the world gon' take this
They might hate it, but you don't know anything about me
You know I'll leave 'em changing
'Cause you know I'm real with it, don't care if you feeling it
I'm feeling it, you don't like it then deal with it, <br>and if God ain't real, real isn't
You still wonder why I existed, I exist in the world that's real different
And what you gon' be when you grow up Nate? I doubt they will get it
My life is a mess, better watch your step when you step in it
Some of this brain is off limits I'm off in a
World that you don't get cause you ain't ever been in it
In 10 minutes, I still couldn't explain what's inside my brain, don't mess with it
I've invested a lot of me inside these lines, I'm just protecting 'em
Everybody wanna hear the real version of life then don't get so sensitive
When I say something a little bit raw
I jot my thoughts and they call it negative
You wanna know where my heart is? I stand out cause I wear my garbage
I work my hardest and every time I look into the mirror
Don't forget about where I started
Tell me what am I doing?
Tell me what am I doing?
Tell me what am I, what am I doing?
Mmm
Tell me what am I doing?
I say what am I doing?
Tell me what am I doing here?
If I'm not being real, mmm
	</pre></li>
	
	
	<li><span class="text1t">Oh Lord</span>
	
<pre>When I die, put my ashes in the trash bag
I don't care where they go
Don't waste your money on my gravestone
I'm more concerned about my soul
Everybody's gon' die
Don't everybody live though
Sometimes I look up to the sky
And wonder do You see us down here?
Oh Lord, oh Lord, do You see us down here?
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Listen, yeah everybody wants change
Don't nobody wanna change though
Don't nobody wanna pray
Till they got something to pray for
Now everybody's gon' die
But don't everybody live though
Sometimes I look up to the sky
And wonder do you see us down here?
Oh Lord, oh Lord, do You see us down here?
Oh Lord, oh Lord
It's easy to blame God but harder to fix things
We look in the sky like, "why ain't You listening?"
Watching the news in our living rooms on the big screens
And talking 'bout "if God's really real, then where is He?"
You see the same God that you saying might not even exist
Becomes real to us, but only when we dying in bed
When ya healthy it's like, we don't really care for Him then
Leave me alone God, I'll call you when I need you again
Which is funny, everyone will sleep in the pews
Then blame God for our problems like He sleeping on you
We turn our backs on Him, what do you expect Him to do?
It's hard to answer prayers when nobody's praying to you
I look around at this world we walk on
It's a smack in the face, don't ever tell me there's no God
And if there isn't then what are we here for?
And what are y'all doing down there? I don't know Lord
Oh Lord, oh Lord, do You see us down here?
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Do You see us down here? Oh Lord
Can You see us down here? Oh Lord
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Can You see us? Can't You see us?	</pre></li>

Overheats in the day, so I drive at night
And I know it sounds funny but it’s real life
Yeah, I know it sounds funny but it’s real life
I pulled over cause I died at a red light
I thank God for the hard times 'cause they guaranteed
Without him, I wouldn't be here, let's be clear
I was given 2 cars, I ain't really outta money
Tryna rap, making 9 thousand a year
I don't say things, feel for me, I say cause it's real to me
I go to my grandma's, hoping she can make a meal for me

Driving around town in the Grand Prix
People telling me that I should get a plan B
Snow on the windshield, can't see, trying to work
6 in the morning, that's me
Sometimes I miss all those memories
They pop up back in my mind like, "Remember me"
Records stop selling, these people won't care for me
The older you get, the more family is everything

Flew out to see you, it's raining outside
We sat by the water and talked about life

You got me thinking things I never used to
I'm not the phone type, I'd rather be with you
Sometimes I hold back from saying, "I miss you"
But I miss you
I have to admit, on this road I get lonely
But you make me smile every time that you call me
You let me be myself
You don't control me
I got you on my mind, baby

Got you on my mind yeah, tell me what the deal is lately
Yeah, deal is lately, deal is lately
I'm a man of my word, girl believe that

Know that I should relax, hate the way I react
Thinking that I'm good but you know I'm 'bout to relapse
Thinking that I'm good but you know I'm 'bout to relapse

Better do somethin' with your eyelids, I hear a lot of whinin'
But I don’t hear a lot of rhymin', woo
Everybody got opinions, let it go into my ear and then I block that
Put me on stage, I'mma rock that, sayin' you the best? 
Stop that, a phony, I am not that, yeah
What are y'all doin' out here? What are y'all doin' out here?
Maybe you should spend a little less time with the women on your arms 
And a little bit more with your career!
I ain't saying I'm the best but I should be in the top 10
Give me a list of names, I'mma top them
I'm just playing with ya, I don't care where the top is
Leave me at the bottom, let me work for it
You ain't never gonna find another rapper in the game
And tell me that he works more, tell me that he works more, nah
You might see me with my hoody up, I ain't leaving 'til I finish
This industry ain't nothing but a box, but I ain't gon' climb in it
You put me inside a room full of rappers, come back in 5 minutes
I'mma be the only one still alive, with a note on my chest saying that, "I did it"
You do it for fame, we way different
Y'all are looking weak, we ain't cooking in the same kitchen
Everybody got a shirt with a stain in it
Some of us'll never wear it out though, let me get it
I guess that I don't understand
This wasn't part of my plan
Some of these people thinking 'cause they heard the name
That they really know who I am
Bring the beat down
I got no time for these Hollywood people
I'd rather give time to my fans
You'd rather chill with these women that like you for money
But I'd rather chill with my fam, yeah
I'm out here grindin'
I'm out here grindin'
Yeah I see the mic but you looking like a pilot
What's the point of a plane if you don't know how to fly it?
I'm out here grinding, okay okay okay
I'm out here grinding, okay okay okay
I'm out here grinding, okay okay okay
I'm out here grinding, all we do is work, all we do is work
Rise of the underdog, I don't like none of y'all
I'm not like one of y'all
I'm from the jungle, I run with the son of God
Yeah, what is you running for?
They should be running from me
Most of my family, we don't even speak
I'm getting married in 22 weeks
And they still haven't said "Hi" or wanted to meet, huh?
I'm not the type to complain
If we don't get it, we try it again
And I'd die for the gang, misfit my blood
They don't like us and we question they mom like
"Why did - why did you allow your kid to like bad music?"
Promise I do it
I'm tryna give you my everything
I don't care what they are doing
I'm tryna do what they couldn't do
Laugh at the rappers you look up to
Don't waste time with the centerfolds
I'm alive, it's a miracle, freestylin' since middle school
I will battle the principal, we on plot like a funeral
I'm doing me, I don't live for you
Grindin'
I'm out here grinding, okay okay okay

	<pre>We gotta talk about things
We gotta do something different 'cause this isn't working
This isn't working
I don't, I don't know if I can do this
Riding 'round in the city, babe
I know you wish you could change me
Why you mad? Girl, why you angry?
Yeah, why you angry?
Back and forth, you love you hate me
Arguing about the same things
I don't, I don't know if I can do this
I don't, I don't know anymore, baby I don't know anymore
I wish you didn't say things, I wish you didn't say things
That you don't mean, that you don't mean
I wish you didn't say things, I wish you didn't say things
That you don't mean, that you don't mean
Yeah, I mean she wants somebody that's working a 9-5
I apologise but those ain't my hours, you ain't never been with a man
Who's working this kinda job, who works for this kind of drive
I wouldn't be with me either
Hold up, yeah I think that's work on the other line, I gotta go
We can argue some another time
Hand up the phone, I regret it right after
This is the chance that I couldn't just pass up
See I signed a deal, you say that I should've asked ya
I guess I was scared to see how you reacted
And maybe I knew I'd be selfish
These are the things I ain't proud of
I was always the type to get jealous, there's always two sides to the story
And you're not the one that I blame when I tell it, that's real, yeah
You ain't the one, you ain't the one
I mean I should've manned up and that's hard to say as a man
The older I get the more I understand a relationship's <br>more than just holding her hand
I'm sorry, you can blame me, yeah, you can blame me
I wish you didn't say things, I wish you didn't say things
That you don't mean, that you don't mean
I wish you didn't say things, I wish you didn't say things
That you don't mean, that you don't mean
What's going on?
I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel something
There's too many things I'm tryna deal with
And I understand that you don't feel this
I said there's too many things I'm tryna deal with
And I understand I'm hurting your feelings
I know you don't feel this, yeah
I'm just expressing the way that I'm feeling
The things that I'm trying to deal with
I guess I've been trying to hold it all inside
But it's obvious that ain't working
Yeah it's obvious that that ain't working
The only thing we got in common
Is that we got nothing in common, baby</pre></li>
	
	
	<li><span class="text1t">Statement</span>

<pre>I'm boss with it, authentic, all y'all frauds better
Quit with the trash talk before you get tossed in it
Y'all tripping, bar ripping, y'all sipping too much, right to the palms dripping
Lost in it, thoughts different, you don't want no drama? <br>Then don't get involved in it
I'm in a whole different head space, you making money? Well that's great
I got no interest in talking to people that I know are two faced
Too fake, get outta my face, woo
What are you doing in my lane? There's already too many rappers
I'm sick of the traffic and I ain't got no brakes
I already passed you, you don't like what I'm doing, who asked you?
You got into music 'cause you think it's fun, man I'm doing this 'cause I have to
It's real music, chills to it, feel through it, real stupid
Skills truest, quit moving, woo
If I say something, I will do it
I used to dream of these moments
I'm living 'em now
Look up to heaven like mom are you proud?
I'm on a way to New Zealand, I'm up in the clouds, dang
I mean who woulda' known this, who woulda' known this?
This industry never told me I was welcome
I went to the house in the back
And I broke in then told 'em that I would be back
I flat line, all of your whack rhymes, that's mine
Might get away from it boy MM LP, I'm the bad guy, the last time
I have been taking it easy, the game's mine, fame why?
I don't care about none of that, I'm just speaking the trash lines
I grew up on Eminem, now look where the game's at
Lame raps, Hollywood fame acts, I'm sick of the same trash
I got no blunt in my mouth but give me a beat, I'mma blaze that
Give me a beat, I'mma blaze that, you and me ain't in the same class
You and me ain't on the same row, music has always been my home
I used to call up some people that won't call me back,<br> now they blowing up my phone, woo!
Ain't it funny how that works? Mad perks, killing the record
Got blood on my black shirt, <br>I'm jealous in love with the music, don't ever come near her
I ain't from around here, how you let me run it down here?
If that isn't bothering none of you rappers then what are y'all doing out here?
It was like music to my ears, might never make it, I don't care
Drake, I love what you doing but call up the game and tell 'em that I'm here, yeah
I like that, might snap, I laugh,<br> y'all better surrender and get out your white flags
And cancel your flight plans, your career isn't taking off
You sound like a hype man, hit you with the mic stand
And they ask what the hype's about, come and find out,<br> I mean, where is you clowns at?
I been training, pen game is insane, I'm done playing
This music is ground breaking, lung shaking, done waiting
Y'all taking my patience, quit faking, y'all hating, it's crazy
I mean you know who my name is, rhyme slayer, stop Nathan
Woo!	</pre></li>

I just put a hundred in the bank
I don't mean a hundred thousand, haha, yeah, yo, I mean a hundred dollars
They say that I got no humor in music, then why am I smiling?
Why am I smiling, you do not feel it? Why are you lying?
You know somebody that's iller than me? I wanna meet 'em
I wanna meet 'em, enough with the talking, woo, I wanna see 'em
I do not look at these rappers out here like I wanna be 'em
I look at these rappers out here like I wanna beat 'em
I am competitive, always been that way
Always been that way, that'll never change
Fans hit me up on my Instagram like you've been singing too much

I get so personal with you, you feel like you know me, you feel like we met
Fans getting into the music, relating, tell me what's doper than that
How you say you're the best in the game<br> when you sound like you don't even know how to rap?
I used to hand out my demos at shows like listen to me
This ain't what it seems, I never sleep which is funny<br> 'cause I'm out here living the dream
You say you're living the dream, no you just living a dream
Y'all need to wake up and get out of your beds and quit sleeping on me
I got my head in the game, you know what that means?
(You know what that means?)
They got no clue, they got no clue
I thought I already told you before this is all that I do

<pre>	This may be the last sunset I'll see
So I'll take it in, I'll take it in
This may be the last air that I'll breathe
I'll breathe it in, I'll breathe it in
I heard that pictures don't change
Just the people inside of 'em do
Whoever told you that life would be easy
I promise that person was lyin' to you
You got a problem with followin' through
That's why I got a problem with followin' you
You keep lookin' at me like this problem is new
But we’ve been here before, what you tryin' to do?
Don't talk to me like I don't know what you feeling
'Cause I was there with you back in the beginning
Quit looking away when I talk, let me finish
I'm tryna be honest, you're tryna forget me, ugh
What's wrong with you, hey?
I know that you got a lot on your plate
You keep telling me I should get out of your way
But I can't see how you gon' lie to my face
Don't tell me you fine 'cause I know that you not so don't even try
And what we gon' live for in this life full of pain 
'Til we're eighty and one day we'll get up and say we regretted our lives
That's where we going
Do not pretend like you don't even notice
Funny thing is that you already know it
I'm starting to think that you like how I feel so be lost in the moment
Lost, lost in the moment
Lost in the moment, lost in the moment
And get lost, lost in the moment
Lost in the moment, lost in the moment
Yeah, they told us that time flies, didn't know what it means
Now I feel like we just running around tryna
Catch it and hoping to cut up its wings
But that ain't gon' happen
Joy, when was the last time we had it?
I don't remember 'cause all that we do
Is go backwards but that's what you get
When you live in the past
And I know we breathing but we not alive
Really, is this the way we wanna die?
'Til you got everything bottled inside
If only they knew what goes on in our minds
I know what you thinking so don't try to hide
Why do you look at me like you surprised?
If you really mean what you write in these lines
Why don't you fix it? 'Cause I'm getting tired
Yeah, I can no longer do this
Ever since you fell in love with the music
See, you find a way to express what you feel
But the moment that you get away from the mic
You don't know what you doing
Is it clear to you yet?
I don't know what's going on in your head
But eventually, you'll have to deal with the things
That you talk about yeah, but I guess until then, we're lost
Lost, lost in the moment
Lost in the moment, lost in the moment
And get lost, lost in the moment
Lost in the moment, lost in the moment
Yeah, oh oh oh, yeah, oh lost
Oh, yeah, oh, no no
This may be the last sunset I'll see
I'll take it in, I'll take it in
This may be the last day that I'll breathe
I'll breathe it in, I'll breathe it in</pre></li>
