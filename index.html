		NF started his career at the Fine Arts Festival organized by Connection<br>
		Church in Canton, Michigan.</a>
		
		
		
	
			

	<a id="2" name="2"></a><p><font color="red"><h2>2</font></h2>Feuerstein stated that, during his childhood, rap was an escape for him.<br>
 He would record songs on a karaoke machine, recording the instrumentals on one<br>
 microphone and his raps on the other. In November 29, 2010, Feuerstein <br>
independently-released his debut studio album Moments under his real name.<br>
 In 2012, Feuerstein's work attracted the attention of Xist Music. <br>
The release of a self-titled EP, NF, was advertised but a label dispute with Xist<br>
 caused them to part ways and the production of the EP was postponed.<br>
 Despite this, NF featured his song "Only One", featuring Shuree Williams,<br>
 in Xist's compilation album, MOVE Vol 1. He released a single, Beautiful Addiction,<br>
 on November 4, 2013 under the alias Nate Feuerstein.<br></p>

	<p>Feuerstein signed to Capitol CMG in 2014, before the release of the EP,<br>
 NF This project was his breakthrough release on the Billboard, as it charted<br>
 on the Christian Albums chart at No. 12, on the Top Gospel Albums at No. 4,<br>
 and on the Top Rap Albums at No. 15. This extended play was reviewed by Jesus<br>
 Freak Hideout and New Release Tuesday, receiving two three-and-a-half-star reviews.<br>
 CCM Magazine reviewed the EP and awarded it four stars. His first studio album,<br>
 Mansion, was released on March 31, 2015 by Capitol CMG.<br></p>

	<p>His song "Intro" is included in the video game Madden NFL 16. <br>
NF's songs have been played on ESPN, VH1, Showtime, NBC's Chicago P.D., Grimm,<br>
 Shades of Blue and in the season finale trailer of Fox's Empire. <br>
His music video for "Intro" premiered on MTV.com's homepage, and the video has also appeared on MTVU, <br>
AbsolutePunk, 2DOPEBOYZ, Raps & Hustles and The College Dropouts.<br></p>

	<p>His second studio album, Therapy Session, was released on April 22, 2016.<br>
 "I Just Wanna Know" was released as a single on April 8, 2016 and "Real" was released on April 22, 2016.<br>
 "Warm Up" was released as a non-album single on September 8, 2016.<br></p>

	<p>On October 6, 2017, NF released his third studio album, Perception. The album debuted at No.<br>
 1 on the Billboard 200, making it his first chart topping album and only the second artist <br>
in 2017 to release a number one album without having charted on the Hot 100. The next week,<br> 
"Let You Down" became his first single to chart on the Hot 100, debuting at 87. It became a sleeper hit,<br>
 taking 17 weeks to reach its peak at number 12. After the success of Perception <br>
he announced he would begin touring mid-2018 with rappers Logic and Kyle.<br></p>

	<a id="3" name="3"></a><p><font color="red"><h2>3</font></h2><p>In 2018, NF released non-album two singles, "No Name" on January 19 and "WHY" on June 18.
	Feuerstein has credited Eminem as his prime influence in hip-hop,<br>
 claiming that at one point that was all he listened to. NF's style has been <br>
compared to that of Eminem, Logic, and Machine Gun Kelly. <br>
Although he found his musical upbringing in Christian hip-hop, Feuerstein has<br>
 denied his label as a Christian rapper, saying "I’m a Christian, <br>
but I don't make Christian music. You’re not going to reach everyone with just one point of view.<br>
 I write about things I’m actually dealing with. You don't have to be Christian to relate to them."<br></p>

<p>In 2013, Feuerstein appeared on Christian hip-hop artist Flame's album Royal Flush on the track,<br>
 "Start Over". In 2015, his feature on TobyMac's This Is Not a Test track "Till the Day I Die" <br>
gained him fame and recognition in the Christian hip-hop genre. Feuerstein's 2017 collaboration with Futuristic, <br>
"Epiphany" enhanced his career in the secular rap industry.<br></P>
